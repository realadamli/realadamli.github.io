                    <h5><b>Annie Duke - Thinking In Bets (Aidan Hornsby - Medium)</b></h5>
	                   <hr />
                    <p><h3>Overview</h3>
<p>Last time, we covered Chapter 1 of “Thinking In Bets” by Annie Duke. We talked about the idea of separating instances of luck vs. skill, as well as being less outcome dependent when we frame the way we look at our decisions. Additionally, we discussed about being comfortable with this idea of uncertainty, where we strive to make the most optimal decisions in a game of limited information. Chapter 2 discusses re-framing our decisions into “bets”, the inherent problems with our beliefs and biases, as well as redefining what it means to be confident in our decisions.</p>

<h3>Chapter 2: Wanna Bet?</h3>

<blockquote>Playing poker for a living has the allure of giving you the freedom to make your own schedule but, once it boils down to your per-hour net advantage, you are tethered to putting in the hours. You're "free" to play or not to play whenever you want, but you can feel compelled to punch a clock.</blockquote>

<p>This quote really struck a chord with me because of it’s application to trading. We often trade because we want the flashy models and bottles on yacht lifestyle that we see from “successful” traders trying to sell us $3000 courses that they ripped straight from somewhere or someone. But, when it comes down to it, you need to put in the hours. Keep in mind this does not mean you need to be “in the market” all this time, just like a poker player doesn’t need to play every single hand. But being “at the table” and present even when nothing is going on is a crucial aspect of this game.</p>

<p>Chapter 2 talks all about the decisions that we make. Every decision that we make (and others make) is in one form or another, a type of bet. A bet that this decision will add value to our life (whether short-term, long-term, it doesn’t matter). By treating our decisions as bets, we need to recognize that we are effectively deciding on alternative futures, each with benefits and risks. Additionally, these futures have certain unknowns and “what-ifs” that we must be okay with accepting. The goal of this book is to understand the thought processes behind our decisions and our psychology so that we can ultimately make better decisions and anticipate when our irrationality may be leading us astray from optimality.</p>

<p>Let’s change our traditional view of betting (wagering against someone else on a chance of a favorable outcome of some event) to a more broad one: a choice made by thinking about what will probably happen, and to risk losing something when you try to do or achieve something.</p>

<blockquote>No matter how far we get from the familiarity of betting at a poker table or in a casino, our decisions are always bets. We routinely decide among alternatives, put resources at risk, assess the likelihood of different outcomes, and consider what it is that we value. Every decision commits us to some course of action that, by definition, eliminates acting on other alternatives. Not placing a bet on something is, itself, a bet.</blockquote>

<p>Some more examples of decisions re-framed as bets:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Going to the movies - we are choosing to not do all the other things with our time that we might do during those hours</li>
  <li>Parenting choices - we are betting that our choice will achieve the future we want for our child more than any other choice we may make</li>
  <li>Job and relocation decisions, sales negotiations and contracts, buying a house, ordering the chicken instead of the steak. These are all bets.</li>
</ol>

<p>The reason we don’t think of decisions as bets is because we attach the zero-sum nature of betting to our concept of a bet (ie. betting against somebody else where one person wins and one person loses). However, in most of our decisions we are betting against all of the future versions of ourselves that we are not choosing.</p>

<blockquote>Have you ever had a moment of regret after a decision where you felt, "I knew I should have made the other choice!"? That's an alternative version of you saying, "See, I told you so!"</blockquote>

<p>But, how can we make sure we are choosing the best alternative? Well, we can’t. There are things that are out of our control and we live in a world with imperfect and hidden information. The best that we can do is to make the best guess given the information at hand, and learn to be comfortable with this uncertainty. However, all is not lost! The good news is that through experience, we can become more effective navigators of our beliefs in situations with imperfect information. Additionally, there is also skill in the ability to identify when our thinking patterns are leading us down the wrong alleyway, and we can use this skill to develop strategies to work with or around our thinking patterns.</p>

<p>This is how you think you form beliefs:</p>
<ol>
  <li>You hear something</li>
  <li>You think about its validity</li>
  <li>You form your beliefs</li>
</ol>

<p>However, in reality, the process is this:</p>
<ol>
  <li>You hear something</li>
  <li>You believe it to be true</li>
  <li>You vet it later if you have time to determine its validity</li>
</ol>

<p>To learn more about this, you can take a look at the idea of System 1 and System 2 from Dan Kahneman’s Thinking, Fast and Slow (and others, this is just the most easily digestible one), because this is exactly how your mind works in order to minimize unnecessary workload or strain on its System 2. We discussed this briefly in the Chapter 1 Summary.</p>

<p>A good example of the bias in our beliefs can be seen in a 1954 paper titled “They Saw a Game”, and a 2012 Stanford Law Review called “They Saw a Protest”. Essentially, if you show the same thing to different groups (each with their own set of beliefs), each group will exhibit biases that conform to their set of beliefs. For example if you show a Princeton student a Princeton football game, he/she is more likely to see instances where the other team committed fouls or penalties. Likewise, if you show a student from the opposing school the same film, he/she will actually be more inclined to see more fouls or penalities committed by the Princeton team.</p>

<blockquote>Once a belief is lodged, it becomes difficult to dislodge... leading us to notice and seek out evidence confirming our belief, rarely challenge the validity of confirming evidence, and ignore or work hard to actively discredit information contradicting the belief...[this] is called motivated reasoning.</blockquote>

<p>Humans are stubborn as hell. We hear what we want to hear and get upset if other people disagree with our beliefs, even when confronted with facts or reasoning. This is because we think of our beliefs as black and white (100% right or 100% wrong). Therefore, we only have two options: to either create a massive shift in our opinion from right to wrong, or to ignore or discredit any new information. Obviously, it feels bad to be wrong so most people choose Option 2. Additionally, being intelligent can actually make this bias worse. This is because the smarter you are, the better you are at creating a narrative that justifies and supports your beliefs.</p>

<blockquote>We are wired to protect our beliefs even when our goal is to truthseek.</blockquote>

<p>So, how do we fix this? We can train ourselves to view the world through the phrase: “Wanna bet?”. This phrase forces us to confront Step 3 of our belief process (vetting it later if you have time to determine its validity). Being asked if we are willing to bet money on it makes us much more likely to examine the information in an unbiased and objective manner. The more honest we are with our perspective, the more accurate our beliefs become. Additionally, we can try to change the way we think about “right” or “wrong” by incorporating uncertainty into our beliefs. For example, instead of saying “Citizen Kane won the Oscar for best picture”, we can say something like: “I think Citizen Kane won the Oscar for best picture, but I’m only a six (60% sure) on that.” By stating our level of certainty, we force ourselves to express how sure we are of our beliefs and brings the probabilistic nature of those beliefs to light.</p>

<blockquote>The person who wins bets over the long run is the one with the more accurate beliefs.</blockquote>

<p>Incorporating uncertainty into the way we think about our beliefs can help us in a multitude of areas. Expressing our level of confidence in our beliefs allows us to shift our approach to our view of the world. By acknowledging uncertainty, we take the first step in being able to measure and narrow it down. Working towards belief calibration also allows us to become less judgmental on ourselves, as we are no longer tied to a black and white, 100% or 0% narrative.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading.</p>
