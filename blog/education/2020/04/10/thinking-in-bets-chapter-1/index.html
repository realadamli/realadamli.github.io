	                   <hr />
                    <p><h3>Overview</h3>
<p>Annie Duke, nicknamed “The Duchess of Poker” and a World Series of Poker gold bracelet holder, is a professional poker player, business consultant, and author, best known for her work on human behavior and decision-making. Her book, “Thinking In Bets”, sheds light on how our everyday decisions and our opinions/biases about those decisions affect our daily life. The book discusses the element of uncontrollable luck, games of incomplete information, and how we can use uncertainty to our advantage. In this post, we’ll go over the first few chapters of the book, as well as some additional commentary on how to possibly apply this to trading and trading performance.</p>

<h3>Chapter 1: Life Is Poker, Not Chess</h3>
<p>The main idea of Chapter 1 is that we often tie the “goodness” or “badness” of a decision based on the result (known as resulting). Annie gives the example of coach Pete Carroll from the Seattle Seahawks, where he called for a controversial play in the last moments of the 2015 Super Bowl. Without going into the specifics, the play ended up not working and Pete was bombarded by the public with criticism and insults. However, can you imagine if the play had worked? Instead of being dragged through the gutter, Pete would have been praised for his “brilliant call” and for being one of the top coaches in the league. It’s important to note here that Pete’s call was not a “hail mary” play (one where the probability of success is low but can win you the game if it succeeds). Instead, it was a good-quality decision that he came to after serious deliberation and thought. It was just unfortunate that the result did not go his way. This brings up a very good point about our psychology:</p>

<p>Humans are inherently bad at separating luck and skill.</p>

<p>Think about how you frame good and bad results. If you think back to the best decision you made last year, then the worst decision you made, you may find that the good decision preceded a good result and the bad decision preceded a bad result. However, just because the result was positive doesn’t necessarily mean the decision was good. For example, if you drive home under the influence successfully, that doesn’t make driving under the influence a good decision. You just got lucky! Beliefs like this develop from the correlation we give to the relationship between our decisions and the outcomes of our decisions.</p>

<p>But why is this?</p>

<blockquote>To start, our brains evolved to create certainty and order. We are uncomfortable with the idea that luck plays a significant role in our lives. We recognize the existence of luck, but we resist the idea that, despite our best efforts, things might not work out the way we want. It feels better for us to imagine the world as an orderly place, where randomness does not wreak havoc and things are perfectly predictable. We evolved to see the world that way. Creating order out of chaos has been necessary for our survival.</blockquote>

<p>Annie goes on to talk about how our ancestors had a strong need to be able to find predictable connections (bush rustling = tiger coming). It’s much safer from a predator-prey standpoint to incorrectly deduce that the rustling in the bush is a tiger (false positive). On the other hand, it’s fatal to assume that the rustling is just the wind when in fact it was a tiger (false negative). Because of the fact that humans seek certainty, it creates many psychological biases and cognitive traps (correlation =/= causation!).</p>

<p>The idea that we have different brain functions that compete to control our decisions has been thoroughly documented in psychology, such as in Daniel Kahneman’s “Thinking Fast and Slow” and multiple other sources. The basic idea is simple: we have two modes of thinking (what you call them is not important, but for the sake of simplicity I will use “System 1” and “System 2” from “Thinking Fast and Slow”).</p>

<dl>
<dt><b>
System 1:</b></dt><dd>Reflex, instinct, intuition, impulse, automatic processing. Largely used almost unconsciously (the reflexive system).</dd><br />


<dt><b>System 2:</b></dt><dd>Complex decisions, concentration, anything that requires mental energy. Basically anything that requires us to think or calculate (the deliberative system).</dd>
</dl>

<p>System 1 holds numerous shortcuts (basically instincts, reflexes, habits) designed to keep us alive, executing thousands of decisions every day. However, these shortcuts often come at a cost, and is often prone to bias and error. The goal is not to change the way our brains work, but to understand and figure out how to work within the constraints of our brain. We can look for practical strategies that help us take advantage of our brain’s strengths and minimize its weaknesses.</p>

<blockquote>Our goal is to get our reflexive minds to execute on our deliberative minds' best intentions.</blockquote>

<p>Arenas like poker (and trading) are excellent for finding these strategies. We have to make multiple decisions in short periods of time, each with its own financial consequence, all while moving towards a deliberate long-term goal. We need to not only this all this, but also adapt to changing conditions in a game with other players that have unknown variables and are also competing and trying to beat you. Additionally, we are also required to collect and analyze all of this data in an attempt to improve our edge (all while discerning between what was luck and what was skill). Then, even if we know the theory, we still need to execute our gameplan, stay rational, and keep emotions out of the process. This is what makes games of incomplete information like poker or trading so difficult.</p>

<p>One of the main takeaways from this chapter is this idea that life is a game of incomplete information (like poker). Unlike games of complete information (like chess), there is no certainty in your decision making process. You can go back in chess and find exactly where you made a mistake and exactly where a better move was, but you can’t do that in poker (and life). There is this element of uncertainty, where valuable information remains hidden and there is an element of luck in any outcome. You can make the best decisions possible in games of incomplete information and still lose. This is why it’s so important to separate the quality of a decision and its outcome, and also be okay with being uncertain (it’s okay to say “I don’t know”).</p>

<blockquote>What makes a decision great is not that is has a great outcome. A great decision is the result of a good process, and that process must include an attempt to accurately represent our own state of knowledge. That state of knowledge, in turn, is some variation of "I'm not sure."</blockquote>

<p>Good decision makers are comfortable with the fact that the world is uncertain. Instead of focusing on being certain, they use the information they have to try and make the best calculated decision they can. Sometimes, this might even mean picking the “least-worst” one that doesn’t even have a high chance of success! Chasing certainty puts you in a black and white world, but in reality its a spectrum. We can change this by reframing the way we look at the idea of “wrong”. Instead of looking at it as “wrong” and/or “right”, we can look at decisions or plays as percentages (I am 60% certain, etc.), and adjust these percentages according to the amount of information we have. It’s important to note that percentages are just that, percentages. Just because you have a 90% chance of success does not mean that you will succeed. The example used in the book refers to the polling percentages for the 2016 presidency and the betting shops for the Brexit vote. Both times the outcome was the option with the lower percentage, but that does not mean that the polls or the betting shops were wrong.</p>

<blockquote>Decisions are bets on the future, and they aren't "right" or "wrong" based on whether they turn out well on any particular iteration. An unwanted result doesn't make our decision wrong if we thought about the alternatives and probabilites in advance and allocated our resources accordingly...</blockquote>

<p>While redefining wrong allows us to make better decisions as we move from thinking in black and white to thinking in shades of grey, we must also redefine what “right” means. If our decision wasn’t wrong just because we didn’t get the projected outcome, it doesn’t mean our decision was right just because it turned out the way we wanted it to. We need to be able to objectively analyze (to the best of our ability) when we made good and bad decisions, regardless of outcome.</p>

<blockquote>...being wrong hurts us more than being right feels good. We know... that losses in general feel about two times as bad as wins feel good.</blockquote>
