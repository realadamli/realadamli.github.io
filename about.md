<h1>Welcome to Kōan Trading</h1>
<blockquote>A kōan is a paradoxical anecdote or riddle, used in Zen Buddhism to demonstrate the inadequacy of logical reasoning and to provoke enlightenment.</blockquote>

<p>  Kōans are meant to exhaust both the analytic intellect and the egoist will, readying the mind to entertain an appropriate response on the intuitive level. The concept of kōans comes down to the interpretation of information, and ultimately a test of competence (thus the similarities between kōans and trading financial markets should be clear).</p>

<h2>About</h2>
<p>Kōan Trading is a personal trading and development blog. Here, you can find posts about market analysis, trading and trader progress, educational content such as book summaries and insights, as well as miscellaneous information related to trading performance.</p>

<p> I am a part-time discretionary trader using order-flow, market profile, and technical analysis. Primarily, this blog serves as an archive of my progress as a trader. If somehow my content is helpful or provides value to anyone, then I'm glad it did so (but that is not my primary focus). In addition, I am looking to develop a condition-based trading system that returns adequate expectancy on a consistent basis. </p>
