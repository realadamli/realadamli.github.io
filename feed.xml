        <title>Principles - Ray Dalio (Part 1)</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Introduction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Principles are concepts that can be applied over and over again in similar circumstances as distinct from narrow answers to specific questions... Principles are ways of successfully dealing with the laws of nature or the laws of life. Those who understand more of them and understand them well know how to interact with the world more effectively than those who know fewer of the mor know them less well.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ray Dalio’s “Principles” dives into the mind of one of the most successful hedge fund managers of all time. In Part 1, he discusses the idea of purpose and the importance of having fundamental life principles. He encourages the reader to explore and discover his/her own set of principles, and hopes that this process will allow the reader to come to his/her own encounters with reality and their reflections on these encounters (rather than blindly accepting someone else’s principles).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part 1: The Importance of principles&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first part of Principles begins with a look into a few questions essential to understanding each other’s principles (and by extension to understand each other).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are principles?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Values that you consider important (literally what you “value”). Principles connect your values to your actions, and help you deal with the laws of reality. In hard times or times of tough choices, you turn to your principles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why are principles important?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;All successful people operate by principles that help them be successful.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Principles create a sense of order, and without them you would be forced to be reactionary to the happenings around you. Operating without principles is bad for individuals and worse for groups (it leads to a lack of understanding of their own values and how to behave in order to be consistent with those values).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where do principles come from?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It can be difficult to come up with your own principles, but adopting pre-packaged principles without much self-thought exposes you to an inconsistency risk with your own true values. Your principles need to be a reflection of the true values that you believe in (incompatible principles lead to conflict).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you have principles that you live your life by? What are they?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Your principles will determine your standards of behavior... People who have shared values and principles get along. People who don't will suffer throug constant misunderstandings and conflicts with one another.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do you value most deeply?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How well do you think they will work, and why?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Those principles that are most valuable come from our own experiences and our reflections on those experiences. Every time we face hard choices, we refine our principles by asking ourselves difficult questions.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be most effective, principles must be consistent with your values, and this requires you to ask the question: Why?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be successful, you must make correct but tough choices; to be a great leader, you must remember that you will have to make these choices by understanding and caring for your people, not by following them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He goes on to remind the reader that when considering each principle, please ask yourself: “Is it true?” It’s important to never blindly adopt other people’s principles, but rather to carefully consider and discuss each one. Everyone ultimately operates on their own set of principles.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Weekly Market Analysis (April 20th, 2020)</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Overview&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week ended as the 5th consecutive green week on the weekly chart. Price has been steadily increasing ever since the massive sell-off in mid-March. Halvening posts are rampant across Twitter as gigabulls cry for the downfall of the traditional monetary system in favor of decentralized cryptocurrency (with permabears calling for sub 2k prices). Coronavirus fears are still at an all-time high as countries struggle to contain it and enforce social distancing and quarantine procedures. However, I’m not an economist so I have really no idea what I’m talking about from a fundamental analysis standpoint. Let’s take a look at the 4H Bitcoin chart, as see if there are any clues as to its next directional move. Current price action for the past few weeks have been extremely choppy, as the huge volatility swings of the post-March crash have subsided.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Green Box = High Volume Node&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blue Box = Low Volume Node&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note: The primary goal of this is not to provide in-depth actionable market information or analysis. It’s merely an exercise for me to do every week to stay up-to-date with the market + train myself to quickly analyze and view the big picture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Market Context&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see, Bitcoin has been consistently making higher highs and higher lows, stair-stepping it’s way past both high and low volume nodes. For bulls, a v-bottom reversal looks like it’s in the books, as price is slowly grinding up towards resistance (likely 7.7-8k area). However, it’s worth it to note that this price increase has been on decreasing volume, a combination that is often interpreted as bearish (we want to see volume confirm the trend). It can also be argued that after a capitulation-style dump like the one we saw in March, lower volume is natural (see 2018/19 bottom). After the rejection from the 7.4k area, we saw price trade relatively sideways until it ultimately wicked into 6.5k before buyers grabbed the initiative and pushed price all the way to the 7.3k Point of Control. Today, we did see a rejection from this area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Bitcoin’s correlation with the equities market has dropped a bit, the upcoming weeks will be incredibly vital. If the equities market can complete a v-bottom reversal, then Bitcoin will likely follow. However, if the current rally turns out to be nothing more than a relief rally, Bitcoin will most likely follow in the drop. I don’t know enough about economics or fundamentals to give accurate analysis on this, but all eyes are on the Federal Reserve and their money-printing machine. The recent aid given to small businesses has already run out of money, but a new 2k/month stimulus is in the works of being discussed. Can the Fed keep propping up the economy? The similarities of this crash to previous ones are shockingly similar (particularly the Great Depression). Large crash followed by heavy ~50 retrace, followed by further downside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Technical Analysis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From a technical standpoint, we are developing a rising wedge which is seen as a bearish pattern. Additionally we tested the 7.3k point of control before before rejected on relatively high volume (2x the 20 day average). This structure could be argued as the first lower high of the structure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, 6.3k still has a naked Point of Control that has yet to be touched (which coincides nicely with a technical break target of this rising wedge). On-balance volume seems to have topped out as well, showing higher buyer participation but with price decreasing. The relative strength index shows no real conviction in either direction. Price is hovering at the 50% Fibonacci retracement level from the 10k top, but seemed to be unable to reclaim this level. Open Interest has been steadily decreasing on moves up (generally bearish), but have recently begun to increase as price increases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Current price action from the past week closely resembles price action from the end of March and beginning of April. However, as is the nature of fractals, market structure also resembles the entire structure from the recent 10k trend in Jan/Feb/early March, where price ultimately failed to make higher highs and began to crash (leading to the March 12/13 crash).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bullish Case&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bulls would want to see 7.4k get reclaimed, which all but guarantees a 7.7-8k retest. If price is able to reclaim this level, then it could be fair to say that the v-bottom reversal is complete, and next targets would be around 10k.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is clear that institutions are investing into Bitcoin, but the extent to which they are doing so is not quite clear at this point. The infamous Stock-2-Flow model also predicts a rapid increase in the price of Bitcoin after the halvening. Overall, it’s easy to see the bullish reasons for Bitcoin, and I think that having a reasonable level of exposure here would be a smart idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If 6.9k breaks, then price would need to find support at 6.4k to build a base for further extension. Otherwise, it can be safe to say that the bullish case is invalidated and we can move to the neutral case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Best long-term strategy: Buy-hold&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Best trading strategy: Dips are for buying&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neutral Case&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is potential for a Wyckoff Accumulation schematic to occur here, but it is difficult to determine the presence of the upwards thrust until we see downwards price action. A completion of this schematic would see price range between ~7.5k and 3k. If this were to come true, then the next few months would see incredibly choppy price action as whales are able to easily manipulate and control the market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A range like this would most likely last well into the second quarter of 2021, with multiple retests of both the 3.5-4k area as well as the 7-7.4k area (assuming that the upwards thrust has already been seen). This will give investors ample time to accumulate at relatively cheap prices, and given the efficiency of the Bitcoin mining hardware (allegedly), won’t be too cheap that miners will be forced to liquidate their holdings and cause a downward spiral of selling pressure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If price were to break the 4k area, it would most likely test the 2018/19 bottom. If that were to fail to hold, then we can say that the neutral case is invalidated and move towards the bearish case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Best long-term strategy: Dollar-Cost Average&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Best trading strategy: Swing trade the range extremes and scalp the tight mini-ranges using order flow&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bearish Case&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bears would want to see price ultimately drop below 3k and head towards the previous bull run’s ATH at around 1.2k. Price may ultimate end up ranging between there and 3k for an extended accumulation phase. If this were to happen, it would cause massive pressure to less efficient miners, possibly  resulting in miner capitulation. We would see the network hash rate drop drastically as miners are forced to close businesses, and a full network “cleansing” would take place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the fact that each successive bullrun takes exponentially longer to complete (regardless of halvening time), this could be a real potential outcome. From a logical perspective, it makes sense. Bitcoin has become an established asset with a relatively mid-size market cap. In order to propel it to the 100k+ predictions, a long and extended accumulation phase is almost necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the 1k area were to fail to hold, then there is serious argument not only for the invalidation of the bearish case, but for Bitcoin as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Best long-term strategy: Hail mary limit orders in increments of $100, starting from ~3k all the way down to sub-1k.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Best trading strategy: Swing short&lt;/p&gt;
