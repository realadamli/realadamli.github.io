        <title>Weekly Debrief (April 26th, 2020)</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/assets/images/trader-progress/march-performance-review.jpeg" alt="Weekly Debrief - Net Positive but Terrible Risk Management" class="webfeedsFeaturedVisual"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Overview&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My main focus of this week was to test out a high volume node scalp strategy. Overall, the testing went fantastic and I’m slowly dialing in the variables I need to trade this on a regular basis. Trading on the other hand, didn’t go as well. While I am net positive for the week, I had an abysmal win-rate. I basically did everything you shouldn’t do this week, like revenge trade, over-leverage, no system, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: Ended up taking a successful flip of an absorption level for a clean 4R! Amazing way to end what was a terrible week. This one was a real analyzed setup. Will go over it in a post next week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trades Taken: 13&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Winners: 4&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Losers: 9&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Winrate: 30.77%&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PnL: 4.48%&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main reason for the poor performance is mainly psychological and lack of patience. I struggled very hard this week with simply waiting for opportunities. Instead, I entered the market at the completely wrong times using position sizes that are way too large. A big portion of the losses were due to me learning and testing the high volume node strategy, but losses should not cause me to go on tilt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, my market analysis has only continued to improve. I am able to effectively identify when my setups are occurring and their optimal entry conditions. This gives me great optimism because I am lacking greatly in confidence of my own skills. This lack of confidence is one of the main reasons that I am unable to execute my analysis and often go on psychological tilt. I think time will be the key here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Education&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week I continued to learn about order flow, particularly the footprint tool. I learned multiple different setups as well as concepts that I am trying to apply to my trading. I’ve also picked up the discounted course from MacroHedged (Options), and so far it’s going very well. While I am not an options trader, I think that learning about it can only aid me in my journey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For books, I continued reading Thinking In Bets, Markets In Profile, Mind Over Markets, and Principles. But, I also picked up Anna Couling’s Complete Guide To Volume Profile. To be honest, I haven’t read as much as I should have this week, so I need to improve on that next week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Next Steps&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week, I would like to continue to test and develop this high volume node strategy as I work my way through the MacroHedged options course. I also want to continue reading books primarily on volume profile, market profile, order flow, and general psychology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next week’s goals include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;MacroHedged Options Course&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;More exercise&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Trust development for my own trading + psychological barriers&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;More reading&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

        <title>Trade Review - XBTUSD (April 25th, 2020)</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/assets/images/Screen Shot 4-24-2020 at 11.52 PM.png" alt="Trade Review (XBTUSD: Short) - Double Distribution" class="webfeedsFeaturedVisual"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Setup&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bitcoin formed a clean double distribution TPO setup after it’s rally from 6.8k to 7.5k. Price wicked into the double print TPO low twice, eventually consolidated at the double print before ultimately breaking down (this consolidation was the key to this trade, as it meant that buyers were no longer aggressively responding to the “discount” in prices).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/Screen Shot 4-24-2020 at 11.46 PM.png&quot; alt=&quot;Double Distribution Setup&quot; style=&quot;max-width:100%;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Execution&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The market entry for this needs to be aggressive, as the movements are often quick and violent (and only valid on the break of structure). The typical target for this type of trade is the upper portion of the second distribution. However, there was the presence of a high volume node in the footprint chart, which made a good exit target and a perfect place to flip directional bias into a long.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stops would be difficult to place for this as it is such a low-time frame scalp. Going for a safe stop will dramatically reduce your RR so a extremely tight stop is probably optimal (or even manual close for those with more experience).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Result&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I managed to catch the breakdown, but failed to set a take profit at the high volume node. I ended up closing in mediocre profit but missed the bulk of the profit of the move as well as the bias flip. This was pretty upsetting because I had previously marked the high volume node with long entries only to cancel them mere hours before this trade occurred.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/Screen Shot 4-24-2020 at 10.24 PM.png&quot; alt=&quot;Footprint High Volume Node&quot; style=&quot;max-width:100%;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Notes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, my analysis of the markets has tremendously improved, but my execution and ability to use this analysis is god-awful. This is most likely due to a lack of experience and patience. It seems I am not patient enough to allow my analysis to come to fruition, as this has happened multiple times over the past few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, it was still a win, albeit 1/5th of the optimal project. This was basically the only win I had this week that had sound analysis behind it. I got pretty rekt this week getting lost into the noise, trying out new strategies, not sticking to my system, and just trading on full tilt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Overall Score:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Setup: Above Average - 6/10 (great initial analysis of the double distribution setup, good improvement for spotting the high volume node a day before, but poor performance for not being able to add all these variables together when it mattered)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Execution: Below Average - 3/10 (the double distribution entry was fine, but this trade basically lay itself out for me and I still wasn’t able to capitalize on it. Talk about dropping the ball!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trade Management: Below Average - 4/10 (failure to assimilate all of this different information into )&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Thinking In Bets (Annie Duke) - Chapter 2</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/assets/images/education/thinking-in-bets.jpeg" alt="Annie Duke - Thinking In Bets (Aidan Hornsby - Medium)" class="webfeedsFeaturedVisual"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Overview&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last time, we covered Chapter 1 of “Thinking In Bets” by Annie Duke. We talked about the idea of separating instances of luck vs. skill, as well as being less outcome dependent when we frame the way we look at our decisions. Additionally, we discussed about being comfortable with this idea of uncertainty, where we strive to make the most optimal decisions in a game of limited information. Chapter 2 discusses re-framing our decisions into “bets”, the inherent problems with our beliefs and biases, as well as redefining what it means to be confident in our decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Chapter 2: Wanna Bet?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Playing poker for a living has the allure of giving you the freedom to make your own schedule but, once it boils down to your per-hour net advantage, you are tethered to putting in the hours. You're &quot;free&quot; to play or not to play whenever you want, but you can feel compelled to punch a clock.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This quote really struck a chord with me because of it’s application to trading. We often trade because we want the flashy models and bottles on yacht lifestyle that we see from “successful” traders trying to sell us $3000 courses that they ripped straight from somewhere or someone. But, when it comes down to it, you need to put in the hours. Keep in mind this does not mean you need to be “in the market” all this time, just like a poker player doesn’t need to play every single hand. But being “at the table” and present even when nothing is going on is a crucial aspect of this game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chapter 2 talks all about the decisions that we make. Every decision that we make (and others make) is in one form or another, a type of bet. A bet that this decision will add value to our life (whether short-term, long-term, it doesn’t matter). By treating our decisions as bets, we need to recognize that we are effectively deciding on alternative futures, each with benefits and risks. Additionally, these futures have certain unknowns and “what-ifs” that we must be okay with accepting. The goal of this book is to understand the thought processes behind our decisions and our psychology so that we can ultimately make better decisions and anticipate when our irrationality may be leading us astray from optimality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s change our traditional view of betting (wagering against someone else on a chance of a favorable outcome of some event) to a more broad one: a choice made by thinking about what will probably happen, and to risk losing something when you try to do or achieve something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;No matter how far we get from the familiarity of betting at a poker table or in a casino, our decisions are always bets. We routinely decide among alternatives, put resources at risk, assess the likelihood of different outcomes, and consider what it is that we value. Every decision commits us to some course of action that, by definition, eliminates acting on other alternatives. Not placing a bet on something is, itself, a bet.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some more examples of decisions re-framed as bets:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Going to the movies - we are choosing to not do all the other things with our time that we might do during those hours&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Parenting choices - we are betting that our choice will achieve the future we want for our child more than any other choice we may make&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Job and relocation decisions, sales negotiations and contracts, buying a house, ordering the chicken instead of the steak. These are all bets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason we don’t think of decisions as bets is because we attach the zero-sum nature of betting to our concept of a bet (ie. betting against somebody else where one person wins and one person loses). However, in most of our decisions we are betting against all of the future versions of ourselves that we are not choosing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Have you ever had a moment of regret after a decision where you felt, &quot;I knew I should have made the other choice!&quot;? That's an alternative version of you saying, &quot;See, I told you so!&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, how can we make sure we are choosing the best alternative? Well, we can’t. There are things that are out of our control and we live in a world with imperfect and hidden information. The best that we can do is to make the best guess given the information at hand, and learn to be comfortable with this uncertainty. However, all is not lost! The good news is that through experience, we can become more effective navigators of our beliefs in situations with imperfect information. Additionally, there is also skill in the ability to identify when our thinking patterns are leading us down the wrong alleyway, and we can use this skill to develop strategies to work with or around our thinking patterns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is how you think you form beliefs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You hear something&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You think about its validity&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You form your beliefs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, in reality, the process is this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You hear something&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You believe it to be true&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You vet it later if you have time to determine its validity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To learn more about this, you can take a look at the idea of System 1 and System 2 from Dan Kahneman’s Thinking, Fast and Slow (and others, this is just the most easily digestible one), because this is exactly how your mind works in order to minimize unnecessary workload or strain on its System 2. We discussed this briefly in the Chapter 1 Summary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good example of the bias in our beliefs can be seen in a 1954 paper titled “They Saw a Game”, and a 2012 Stanford Law Review called “They Saw a Protest”. Essentially, if you show the same thing to different groups (each with their own set of beliefs), each group will exhibit biases that conform to their set of beliefs. For example if you show a Princeton student a Princeton football game, he/she is more likely to see instances where the other team committed fouls or penalties. Likewise, if you show a student from the opposing school the same film, he/she will actually be more inclined to see more fouls or penalities committed by the Princeton team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Once a belief is lodged, it becomes difficult to dislodge... leading us to notice and seek out evidence confirming our belief, rarely challenge the validity of confirming evidence, and ignore or work hard to actively discredit information contradicting the belief...[this] is called motivated reasoning.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Humans are stubborn as hell. We hear what we want to hear and get upset if other people disagree with our beliefs, even when confronted with facts or reasoning. This is because we think of our beliefs as black and white (100% right or 100% wrong). Therefore, we only have two options: to either create a massive shift in our opinion from right to wrong, or to ignore or discredit any new information. Obviously, it feels bad to be wrong so most people choose Option 2. Additionally, being intelligent can actually make this bias worse. This is because the smarter you are, the better you are at creating a narrative that justifies and supports your beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;We are wired to protect our beliefs even when our goal is to truthseek.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, how do we fix this? We can train ourselves to view the world through the phrase: “Wanna bet?”. This phrase forces us to confront Step 3 of our belief process (vetting it later if you have time to determine its validity). Being asked if we are willing to bet money on it makes us much more likely to examine the information in an unbiased and objective manner. The more honest we are with our perspective, the more accurate our beliefs become. Additionally, we can try to change the way we think about “right” or “wrong” by incorporating uncertainty into our beliefs. For example, instead of saying “Citizen Kane won the Oscar for best picture”, we can say something like: “I think Citizen Kane won the Oscar for best picture, but I’m only a six (60% sure) on that.” By stating our level of certainty, we force ourselves to express how sure we are of our beliefs and brings the probabilistic nature of those beliefs to light.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The person who wins bets over the long run is the one with the more accurate beliefs.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Incorporating uncertainty into the way we think about our beliefs can help us in a multitude of areas. Expressing our level of confidence in our beliefs allows us to shift our approach to our view of the world. By acknowledging uncertainty, we take the first step in being able to measure and narrow it down. Working towards belief calibration also allows us to become less judgmental on ourselves, as we are no longer tied to a black and white, 100% or 0% narrative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Stepping Away From Support and Resistance</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/assets/images/market-analysis/042320-XBTUSD.png" alt="How I Draw My Charts Using Volume Profile (XBTUSD) - TradingView" class="webfeedsFeaturedVisual"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Overview&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Buy support, sell resistance. -basically every trader ever&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea of support and resistance is one of the oldest facets of trading, and for good reason. It can be drawn in such a way that is clear to even a complete beginner, and I believe that it’s perceived simplicity is what makes it such a powerful and prevalent idea. However, is it really that easy? What really is support and resistance? If we’re going to be honest, aren’t we just drawing lines on a chart? And how come it works sometimes and doesn’t work other times? What is price really doing, “under the hood”, as we might say? Today, I want to go over the driving mechanics behind support and resistance, as well as potentially challenge and analyze a few of my own beliefs and ideas (and perhaps even some of yours).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note: This post serves as a “brain-dump” for a lot of the concepts that I have been learning about. It serves as a journal of sorts for me, a place to collect my thoughts and expand upon them. Only by writing my ideas down as if I am explaining them to someone will I be able to effectively gauge how much I know/don’t know, as well as identify areas where I am lacking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is Support and Resistance?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Support and resistance, from how we see it in action, are often simple lines drawn at key areas where the market seemed to have reversed direction. However, anyone who has ever traded can tell you that it is definitely not that simple. Levels get blown through all the time, and price will even extend past or never reach it on a regular basis. This is because the support and resistances that we draw are nothing more than lines on a chart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the reasons I dislike drawing lines as support and resistance is the simplicity of it. Yes, it makes your chart look clean and you can get some clout on Crypto Twitter. But, if you can see it, so can everyone else. And that makes you an easy target. Now, don’t get me wrong, I’m not saying that you should never use lines for levels. The important thing to note here is to not be blinded by them that you fail to recognize external factors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, setting levels using lines may cause you to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Get stopped out before price reverses in your predicted direction.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Miss a move because price didn’t reach your entry.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To minimize this occurrence, we need to understand how price moves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why Do Prices Move?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prices move because there is an imbalance in the activity of buyers or sellers. Many people may say that prices go up if there are more buyers than sellers, but given the way that markets work (a seller for every buyer, and vice versa) that is not technically correct. Instead, prices move when there is an imbalance in the aggressiveness of market participants. If buyers are impatient, they will aggressively bid up price until they believe that it is above value, and vice versa. This idea of a “two-way” auction, where buyers and sellers will react accordingly to below or above value prices is the key concept of auction market theory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the flip side, if prices move due to an imbalance in the aggressiveness of buyers and sellers, what makes price stop? The answer is liquidity. When there is an imbalance in market participant aggression, the market will move until it hits available liquidity. This liquidity will either get eaten up by the aggressive side (and price will continue), or it will prove too strong and price will fail to push through. This is why simply looking at a candlestick chart does not give us enough information about what is actually happening in the battle between buyers and sellers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, if prices have nothing to do with support and resistance lines that we draw, how can we effectively look for entries and targets? This is where we can use things like market profile, volume profile, and order flow!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Role of Volume Profile/Market Profile&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me, volume and market profile lets me see the market from a bird’s eye view. While the two measure different things (one is volume and the other is time), I use them similarly: to show me where buyers/sellers interacted the most. It allows me to spot potential areas of interest through high volume areas and low volume areas. For those of you not familiar with volume or market profile, I highly recommend checking out some online resources (the gentlemen over at Blockroots have an amazing course, and I’ve heard great things about BTCMarketProfile as well as some of the courses from Axia Futures. Alternatively, you can read a few books that I’ve listed at the bottom of this post).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically, I look at two things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Point of Control - I mark these with a green box to indicate to me key areas where market participation was the highest. These often act as support and resistance to price. If you think about the mechanics behind this, this means that at these prices, there was a lot of volume transacted (meaning that at one point, it was a fair value area between buyers/sellers). Hence, it goes to reason that it will be an important area of interest in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Low Volume Areas - I mark these with a blue box to indicate key areas where market participation was low. These are areas where price was below or above value, and buyers or sellers aggressively reacted and immediately took price away from this area (hence the low volume). You may notice that while these act as support and resistance, they will sometimes also be filled out and turned into high volume areas as price comes back and the reactions of the market participants change.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this gives us a good idea of the overall market context, it isn’t accurate enough. Trying to find entries with boxes often gives you a terrible risk:reward unless you’re trading on the higher-time frames. This is where order flow comes in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Role of Order Flow&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If volume/market profile is a bird’s eye view, then order flow is the sniper. It allows you to look into exactly what buyers/sellers transacted at every price point in every candle. Again, I highly recommend checking out something like Blockroots, or some online resources. Currently, EXOCharts is in my opinion the best order flow platform for crypto, with Sierra Charts also being incredibly good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For order flow, I follow a similar process except on a much lower time frame. I’ve found that it is incredibly good at giving you high R:R, low time frame scalps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;High Volume Nodes - I look for price to wick into these areas of high volume. Great for finding pockets of liquidity that almost attracts price like a magnet.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Delta - Delta is the difference in executed orders between the buy and sell side, aggregated for each candle. It shows you the intentions behind the market participants, as lots of aggressive buying will show heavy positive delta (and vice versa for heavy selling). In an uptrend for example, we want to see sustained positive delta. If we begin to see a shift in delta participation from positive to negative, it could tell us buyers are beginning to lose steam and exhaust themselves (aka no more buyers).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Absorption - absorption is important to confirm direction. For any moves, we want to ideally see buyers/sellers absorbing in the direction of the move. For example, on a trend upwards, we want to see buyers absorb (or “reload”) at higher and higher prices, indicating that there are still buyers in the market. If we see heavy selling into clear signs of absorption, it is a sign that buyers are willing to buy at these higher prices, and continuation is probable.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn’t cover a few ideas such as cumulative volume delta, buy/sell imbalances and divergences, so maybe I will save those for a later post. Basically, we want to ask ourselves “where is price trying to go”, and “is it doing a good job of getting there?”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some Suggested Reading:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Anne Couling - A Complete Guide to Volume Profile&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;James F. Dalton - Mind Over Markets and Markets In Profile&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you made it this far, thanks very much for reading!&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/assets/images/education/ray_dalio_principles.jpg" alt="Principles by Ray Dalio (Pic: veronicastenberg.com)" class="webfeedsFeaturedVisual"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Introduction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Principles are concepts that can be applied over and over again in similar circumstances as distinct from narrow answers to specific questions... Principles are ways of successfully dealing with the laws of nature or the laws of life. Those who understand more of them and understand them well know how to interact with the world more effectively than those who know fewer of the mor know them less well.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ray Dalio’s “Principles” dives into the mind of one of the most successful hedge fund managers of all time. In Part 1, he discusses the idea of purpose and the importance of having fundamental life principles. He encourages the reader to explore and discover his/her own set of principles, and hopes that this process will allow the reader to come to his/her own encounters with reality and their reflections on these encounters (rather than blindly accepting someone else’s principles).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part 1: The Importance of principles&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first part of Principles begins with a look into a few questions essential to understanding each other’s principles (and by extension to understand each other).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are principles?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Values that you consider important (literally what you “value”). Principles connect your values to your actions, and help you deal with the laws of reality. In hard times or times of tough choices, you turn to your principles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why are principles important?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;All successful people operate by principles that help them be successful.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Principles create a sense of order, and without them you would be forced to be reactionary to the happenings around you. Operating without principles is bad for individuals and worse for groups (it leads to a lack of understanding of their own values and how to behave in order to be consistent with those values).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where do principles come from?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It can be difficult to come up with your own principles, but adopting pre-packaged principles without much self-thought exposes you to an inconsistency risk with your own true values. Your principles need to be a reflection of the true values that you believe in (incompatible principles lead to conflict).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you have principles that you live your life by? What are they?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Your principles will determine your standards of behavior... People who have shared values and principles get along. People who don't will suffer throug constant misunderstandings and conflicts with one another.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do you value most deeply?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How well do you think they will work, and why?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Those principles that are most valuable come from our own experiences and our reflections on those experiences. Every time we face hard choices, we refine our principles by asking ourselves difficult questions.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be most effective, principles must be consistent with your values, and this requires you to ask the question: Why?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be successful, you must make correct but tough choices; to be a great leader, you must remember that you will have to make these choices by understanding and caring for your people, not by following them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He goes on to remind the reader that when considering each principle, please ask yourself: “Is it true?” It’s important to never blindly adopt other people’s principles, but rather to carefully consider and discuss each one. Everyone ultimately operates on their own set of principles.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Weekly Market Analysis (April 20th, 2020)</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/assets/images/market-analysis/042020-XBTUSD.png" alt="4H Chart for XBTUSD (Bitmex)" class="webfeedsFeaturedVisual"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Overview&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week ended as the 5th consecutive green week on the weekly chart. Price has been steadily increasing ever since the massive sell-off in mid-March. Halvening posts are rampant across Twitter as gigabulls cry for the downfall of the traditional monetary system in favor of decentralized cryptocurrency (with permabears calling for sub 2k prices). Coronavirus fears are still at an all-time high as countries struggle to contain it and enforce social distancing and quarantine procedures. However, I’m not an economist so I have really no idea what I’m talking about from a fundamental analysis standpoint. Let’s take a look at the 4H Bitcoin chart, as see if there are any clues as to its next directional move. Current price action for the past few weeks have been extremely choppy, as the huge volatility swings of the post-March crash have subsided.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Green Box = High Volume Node&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blue Box = Low Volume Node&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note: The primary goal of this is not to provide in-depth actionable market information or analysis. It’s merely an exercise for me to do every week to stay up-to-date with the market + train myself to quickly analyze and view the big picture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Market Context&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see, Bitcoin has been consistently making higher highs and higher lows, stair-stepping it’s way past both high and low volume nodes. For bulls, a v-bottom reversal looks like it’s in the books, as price is slowly grinding up towards resistance (likely 7.7-8k area). However, it’s worth it to note that this price increase has been on decreasing volume, a combination that is often interpreted as bearish (we want to see volume confirm the trend). It can also be argued that after a capitulation-style dump like the one we saw in March, lower volume is natural (see 2018/19 bottom). After the rejection from the 7.4k area, we saw price trade relatively sideways until it ultimately wicked into 6.5k before buyers grabbed the initiative and pushed price all the way to the 7.3k Point of Control. Today, we did see a rejection from this area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Bitcoin’s correlation with the equities market has dropped a bit, the upcoming weeks will be incredibly vital. If the equities market can complete a v-bottom reversal, then Bitcoin will likely follow. However, if the current rally turns out to be nothing more than a relief rally, Bitcoin will most likely follow in the drop. I don’t know enough about economics or fundamentals to give accurate analysis on this, but all eyes are on the Federal Reserve and their money-printing machine. The recent aid given to small businesses has already run out of money, but a new 2k/month stimulus is in the works of being discussed. Can the Fed keep propping up the economy? The similarities of this crash to previous ones are shockingly similar (particularly the Great Depression). Large crash followed by heavy ~50 retrace, followed by further downside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Technical Analysis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From a technical standpoint, we are developing a rising wedge which is seen as a bearish pattern. Additionally we tested the 7.3k point of control before before rejected on relatively high volume (2x the 20 day average). This structure could be argued as the first lower high of the structure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, 6.3k still has a naked Point of Control that has yet to be touched (which coincides nicely with a technical break target of this rising wedge). On-balance volume seems to have topped out as well, showing higher buyer participation but with price decreasing. The relative strength index shows no real conviction in either direction. Price is hovering at the 50% Fibonacci retracement level from the 10k top, but seemed to be unable to reclaim this level. Open Interest has been steadily decreasing on moves up (generally bearish), but have recently begun to increase as price increases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Current price action from the past week closely resembles price action from the end of March and beginning of April. However, as is the nature of fractals, market structure also resembles the entire structure from the recent 10k trend in Jan/Feb/early March, where price ultimately failed to make higher highs and began to crash (leading to the March 12/13 crash).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bullish Case&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bulls would want to see 7.4k get reclaimed, which all but guarantees a 7.7-8k retest. If price is able to reclaim this level, then it could be fair to say that the v-bottom reversal is complete, and next targets would be around 10k.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is clear that institutions are investing into Bitcoin, but the extent to which they are doing so is not quite clear at this point. The infamous Stock-2-Flow model also predicts a rapid increase in the price of Bitcoin after the halvening. Overall, it’s easy to see the bullish reasons for Bitcoin, and I think that having a reasonable level of exposure here would be a smart idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If 6.9k breaks, then price would need to find support at 6.4k to build a base for further extension. Otherwise, it can be safe to say that the bullish case is invalidated and we can move to the neutral case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Best long-term strategy: Buy-hold&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Best trading strategy: Dips are for buying&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neutral Case&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is potential for a Wyckoff Accumulation schematic to occur here, but it is difficult to determine the presence of the upwards thrust until we see downwards price action. A completion of this schematic would see price range between ~7.5k and 3k. If this were to come true, then the next few months would see incredibly choppy price action as whales are able to easily manipulate and control the market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A range like this would most likely last well into the second quarter of 2021, with multiple retests of both the 3.5-4k area as well as the 7-7.4k area (assuming that the upwards thrust has already been seen). This will give investors ample time to accumulate at relatively cheap prices, and given the efficiency of the Bitcoin mining hardware (allegedly), won’t be too cheap that miners will be forced to liquidate their holdings and cause a downward spiral of selling pressure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If price were to break the 4k area, it would most likely test the 2018/19 bottom. If that were to fail to hold, then we can say that the neutral case is invalidated and move towards the bearish case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Best long-term strategy: Dollar-Cost Average&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Best trading strategy: Swing trade the range extremes and scalp the tight mini-ranges using order flow&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bearish Case&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bears would want to see price ultimately drop below 3k and head towards the previous bull run’s ATH at around 1.2k. Price may ultimate end up ranging between there and 3k for an extended accumulation phase. If this were to happen, it would cause massive pressure to less efficient miners, possibly  resulting in miner capitulation. We would see the network hash rate drop drastically as miners are forced to close businesses, and a full network “cleansing” would take place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the fact that each successive bullrun takes exponentially longer to complete (regardless of halvening time), this could be a real potential outcome. From a logical perspective, it makes sense. Bitcoin has become an established asset with a relatively mid-size market cap. In order to propel it to the 100k+ predictions, a long and extended accumulation phase is almost necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the 1k area were to fail to hold, then there is serious argument not only for the invalidation of the bearish case, but for Bitcoin as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Best long-term strategy: Hail mary limit orders in increments of $100, starting from ~3k all the way down to sub-1k.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Best trading strategy: Swing short&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Weekly Debrief (April 19th, 2020)</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/assets/images/trader-progress/march-performance-review.jpeg" alt="Weekly Debrief - Room For Improvement" class="webfeedsFeaturedVisual"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Overview&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week, I put a lot of emphasis on trading Market Profile. This meant primarily two types of trades: VAH/VAL mean reversion trades and Break From Balance trades. While the data for this week is negative, I’m extremely happy with the progress I’ve made in testing this theory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trades Taken: 6&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Winners: 2&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Losers: 4&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Winrate: 33.33%&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PnL: -4.58%&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the primary reasons for the negative PnL is execution. I found that while my VAH/VAL strategy works more often than not, I have a tendency to go on tilt after a stopped trade. This led to poor entries, poor decisions, and an overall loss for the week. Unfortunately, this also caused me to enter into an over-leveraged swing short, which is pretty underwater right now. Liquidation price is nowhere near though, so the risk isn’t too high. I have enough room to be able to close the trade once my thesis is invalidated, albeit at a huge relative loss of capital. I found that my analysis was quite accurate, but my poor execution was the main culprit for the poor performance. This is a recurring theme in my trading, and one that I am trying very hard to fix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Education&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent the vast majority of this week learning Order Flow and Market Profile. Combined with this, I feel like I’ve been able to understand why some of the trades I took this week failed. Simply put, Market Profile is a great tool to get context, but Order Flow is really what I should be using to get sniper-level entries and stop positions. It really is something amazing. Particularly, I want to look at High Volume Nodes as optimal entry areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Next Steps&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next week, I would like to focus on dialing in entries, and tightening up my stops. I’m slowly gravitating towards a more scalp-focused style of trading, as it allows me to be in and out of the market quickly without having to hold positions overnight. Additionally, I want to continue to refine the way that I look at the market, as I feel like I am improving a lot on that aspect.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Trade Review - XBTUSD (April 18th, 2020)</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/assets/images/trader-progress/041820-XBTUSD.png" alt="Trade Review (XBTUSD: Long) - Break from Balance" class="webfeedsFeaturedVisual"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Setup&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided to take a long because price moved outside of the previous day value area, and seemed to show acceptance. My target was set at the range high, where I thought we would have a SFP and drop lower. Stop was placed right below the range POC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Execution&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used a market-order to enter into the market. This 100% should have been a limit order, but I was too impatient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Result&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the trade was stopped out as I don’t trade on Bitmex. I trade on ByBit, so unfortunately the price action there is a bit different. Additionally, the new BTCUSDT chart from ByBit is not on TradingView yet, so I was unable to do comprehensive data analysis to find the best price points. This is very disheartening as you can see price coming back to test the POC before ultimately moving up toward my target. This has been a recurring issue lately, so I need to address this somehow. Perhaps I will move to FTX.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Notes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the market showed clear signs of acceptance, I should have closed and re-entered lower as soon as I saw buyers attempt to take initiative and fail to push price higher. This was a clear sign that while there was acceptance, there was not enough follow through from buyers. A re-entry at the range POC would have seen optimal trade location.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Overall Score:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Setup: Above Average - 7/10 (good initial analysis, but lack of additional supporting factors)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Execution: Mediocre - 5/10 (impatient entry)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trade Management: Below Average - 3.5/10 (failure to adapt to changing conditions)&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Thinking In Bets (Annie Duke) - Chapter 1</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/assets/images/education/thinking-in-bets.jpeg" alt="Annie Duke - Thinking In Bets (Aidan Hornsby - Medium)" class="webfeedsFeaturedVisual"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Overview&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Annie Duke, nicknamed “The Duchess of Poker” and a World Series of Poker gold bracelet holder, is a professional poker player, business consultant, and author, best known for her work on human behavior and decision-making. Her book, “Thinking In Bets”, sheds light on how our everyday decisions and our opinions/biases about those decisions affect our daily life. The book discusses the element of uncontrollable luck, games of incomplete information, and how we can use uncertainty to our advantage. In this post, we’ll go over the first few chapters of the book, as well as some additional commentary on how to possibly apply this to trading and trading performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Chapter 1: Life Is Poker, Not Chess&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main idea of Chapter 1 is that we often tie the “goodness” or “badness” of a decision based on the result (known as resulting). Annie gives the example of coach Pete Carroll from the Seattle Seahawks, where he called for a controversial play in the last moments of the 2015 Super Bowl. Without going into the specifics, the play ended up not working and Pete was bombarded by the public with criticism and insults. However, can you imagine if the play had worked? Instead of being dragged through the gutter, Pete would have been praised for his “brilliant call” and for being one of the top coaches in the league. It’s important to note here that Pete’s call was not a “hail mary” play (one where the probability of success is low but can win you the game if it succeeds). Instead, it was a good-quality decision that he came to after serious deliberation and thought. It was just unfortunate that the result did not go his way. This brings up a very good point about our psychology:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Humans are inherently bad at separating luck and skill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think about how you frame good and bad results. If you think back to the best decision you made last year, then the worst decision you made, you may find that the good decision preceded a good result and the bad decision preceded a bad result. However, just because the result was positive doesn’t necessarily mean the decision was good. For example, if you drive home under the influence successfully, that doesn’t make driving under the influence a good decision. You just got lucky! Beliefs like this develop from the correlation we give to the relationship between our decisions and the outcomes of our decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But why is this?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;To start, our brains evolved to create certainty and order. We are uncomfortable with the idea that luck plays a significant role in our lives. We recognize the existence of luck, but we resist the idea that, despite our best efforts, things might not work out the way we want. It feels better for us to imagine the world as an orderly place, where randomness does not wreak havoc and things are perfectly predictable. We evolved to see the world that way. Creating order out of chaos has been necessary for our survival.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Annie goes on to talk about how our ancestors had a strong need to be able to find predictable connections (bush rustling = tiger coming). It’s much safer from a predator-prey standpoint to incorrectly deduce that the rustling in the bush is a tiger (false positive). On the other hand, it’s fatal to assume that the rustling is just the wind when in fact it was a tiger (false negative). Because of the fact that humans seek certainty, it creates many psychological biases and cognitive traps (correlation =/= causation!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea that we have different brain functions that compete to control our decisions has been thoroughly documented in psychology, such as in Daniel Kahneman’s “Thinking Fast and Slow” and multiple other sources. The basic idea is simple: we have two modes of thinking (what you call them is not important, but for the sake of simplicity I will use “System 1” and “System 2” from “Thinking Fast and Slow”).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;b&gt;
System 1:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dd&gt;Reflex, instinct, intuition, impulse, automatic processing. Largely used almost unconsciously (the reflexive system).&lt;/dd&gt;&lt;br /&gt;


&lt;dt&gt;&lt;b&gt;System 2:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dd&gt;Complex decisions, concentration, anything that requires mental energy. Basically anything that requires us to think or calculate (the deliberative system).&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;

&lt;p&gt;System 1 holds numerous shortcuts (basically instincts, reflexes, habits) designed to keep us alive, executing thousands of decisions every day. However, these shortcuts often come at a cost, and is often prone to bias and error. The goal is not to change the way our brains work, but to understand and figure out how to work within the constraints of our brain. We can look for practical strategies that help us take advantage of our brain’s strengths and minimize its weaknesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Our goal is to get our reflexive minds to execute on our deliberative minds' best intentions.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arenas like poker (and trading) are excellent for finding these strategies. We have to make multiple decisions in short periods of time, each with its own financial consequence, all while moving towards a deliberate long-term goal. We need to not only this all this, but also adapt to changing conditions in a game with other players that have unknown variables and are also competing and trying to beat you. Additionally, we are also required to collect and analyze all of this data in an attempt to improve our edge (all while discerning between what was luck and what was skill). Then, even if we know the theory, we still need to execute our gameplan, stay rational, and keep emotions out of the process. This is what makes games of incomplete information like poker or trading so difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the main takeaways from this chapter is this idea that life is a game of incomplete information (like poker). Unlike games of complete information (like chess), there is no certainty in your decision making process. You can go back in chess and find exactly where you made a mistake and exactly where a better move was, but you can’t do that in poker (and life). There is this element of uncertainty, where valuable information remains hidden and there is an element of luck in any outcome. You can make the best decisions possible in games of incomplete information and still lose. This is why it’s so important to separate the quality of a decision and its outcome, and also be okay with being uncertain (it’s okay to say “I don’t know”).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;What makes a decision great is not that is has a great outcome. A great decision is the result of a good process, and that process must include an attempt to accurately represent our own state of knowledge. That state of knowledge, in turn, is some variation of &quot;I'm not sure.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good decision makers are comfortable with the fact that the world is uncertain. Instead of focusing on being certain, they use the information they have to try and make the best calculated decision they can. Sometimes, this might even mean picking the “least-worst” one that doesn’t even have a high chance of success! Chasing certainty puts you in a black and white world, but in reality its a spectrum. We can change this by reframing the way we look at the idea of “wrong”. Instead of looking at it as “wrong” and/or “right”, we can look at decisions or plays as percentages (I am 60% certain, etc.), and adjust these percentages according to the amount of information we have. It’s important to note that percentages are just that, percentages. Just because you have a 90% chance of success does not mean that you will succeed. The example used in the book refers to the polling percentages for the 2016 presidency and the betting shops for the Brexit vote. Both times the outcome was the option with the lower percentage, but that does not mean that the polls or the betting shops were wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Decisions are bets on the future, and they aren't &quot;right&quot; or &quot;wrong&quot; based on whether they turn out well on any particular iteration. An unwanted result doesn't make our decision wrong if we thought about the alternatives and probabilites in advance and allocated our resources accordingly...&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While redefining wrong allows us to make better decisions as we move from thinking in black and white to thinking in shades of grey, we must also redefine what “right” means. If our decision wasn’t wrong just because we didn’t get the projected outcome, it doesn’t mean our decision was right just because it turned out the way we wanted it to. We need to be able to objectively analyze (to the best of our ability) when we made good and bad decisions, regardless of outcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;...being wrong hurts us more than being right feels good. We know... that losses in general feel about two times as bad as wins feel good.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

        <title>How I Optimize My Daily Routine</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/assets/images/miscellaneous/optimizing-daily-routine.jpg" alt="Dolomites Mountains - 4K Wallpaper from hdwallpapers.in" class="webfeedsFeaturedVisual"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Overview&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve always believed that structure is a vital component to a person’s chance of success, yet my own life has always been unstructured and messy. In order for me to take trading seriously, it was crucial that I also take the other factors of my life into account as well. This post goes into my thought process, goals, and end-result of what I think is the most optimal schedule (for me, personally). It may also provide some insight for anyone looking to learn more about how to approach their daily life in a methodical or systematic manner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Assumptions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To create a tailored schedule that was as efficient and optimal as possible, I first needed to make a few basic assumptions about my own personality, habits, and tendencies. To start, I made two major assumptions about my psychology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;b&gt;Assumption 1: &quot;Balance is for suckers.&quot;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Initially, the title of this assumption may be bit misleading. While we hear about the word &quot;balance&quot; in society a lot, I do not believe that balance is the end all be all solution to everyone's problems. For some people it may work great, but personally I believe that I have a very &quot;all-in&quot; personality, where I either do something 100% or not at all (basically, I am terrible at balance). Because of this, it was essential for my schedule to reflect this. This meant that if I wanted to succeed at trading, I need to assume that I would have to reorganize my entire schedule to revolve around it.&lt;/dd&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;dt&gt;&lt;b&gt;Assumption 2: &quot;Habits are difficult to form but easy to break.&quot;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Thanks to my all-in personality, I am also very impulsive. This makes it very difficult to stay on track of tasks as soon as new variables are introduced to the equation. Habits are difficult to form, but even more difficult to keep, and I find myself derailing from my schedule as soon as a minor side task or distraction comes around. This means my schedule needs to contain as many tricks or techniques to keep me focused as possible, and needs to cut out as much noise and distractions as possible.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Goals&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With these assumptions made, I established a few goals that I wanted this schedule to achieve. These are different from the long-term goals that I set out in my “BTC Challenge” post, but rather just a few ideas to keep in mind when formulating the plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Eliminate all non-essential decisions to the best of my ability. This means having the exact same schedule every day of the week, eating the same thing every day to maintain caloric goals, and in general just making as little non-trading decisions to my life as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For all essential decisions, I want to have a clear “flow” in place so that I can go from start to end as fluidly as possible. For example, this means creating a clear documentation process/template for this blog as well as Twitter (I don’t want to waste time figuring out what to write, but rather I can just fill in some pre-existing boxes).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Initiatives and Optimizations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With these goals in mind, we can start creating a list of potential value-add activities we want to add into our schedule. However, given our assumption about habits, we need to approach habit-building with a more methodical approach. To avoid burnout, we will slowly introduce new variables into the schedule as the older activities successfully turn into habits. To aid us in this, we will be using a habit-tracking app (any will do, I personally use Streaks). Listed below are the majority of the activities I plan to add.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;2x Daily Meditation - the benefit here is two-fold. Meditation in the morning to help practice mental acuity and provide me improved professional performance. Meditation at night to aid in falling asleep as quickly as possible. I will be using Headspace, as I’ve found their gamification and design to be the most user-friendly for noobs like me.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Yoga - trading is mainly a sitting activity, and I do not have a standing desk. It’s crucial for me to be flexible and not have my body hold me back after sitting for many hours in the day. I will be using a free app called Down Dog.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Workout - I’ve been into fitness for a long time, but recently I’ve let myself get out of shape (both from laziness as well as coronavirus). It is visibly affecting my life negatively, so I would like to get back into it. I’d like to be a bit more functional, as the past few years I’ve mainly focused on bodybuilding/powerlifting, so I’ve recently downloaded Nike Fitness Club and will be doing workouts on there. Bonus points for being able to do it at home.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Healthy Eating - Similar to #3, I haven’t been able to eat healthy and I feel lethargic and tired all the time. Because I used to be an athlete, I have a solid understanding of nutrition. So, moving forward I will be eating a 2400 calorie diet, 150-180g of protein, 20%-25% of calories will be fat and the rest will be carbohydrates. The goal with this was to slowly lose weight (~1 lb a week), so as to not impair my mental functionality if I were to be more aggressive (2+ lb a week).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cardio - an easy 2-for-1 here, with an hour of walking + an hour of audiobooks every day. I’m not a huge fan of audiobooks because I don’t retain as much information, but something is better than nothing. I’m lucky I have a giant park next to my house.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Books - will be spending the majority of my time reading books. To increase retention, I will be spending more time on each book, but I will be writing down notes and posting them here for future reference. These can be found under the “Education” section of this website.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Schedule&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, this is the schedule that I am currently working with. I’ve split it into blocks/routines, where each section may be comprised of multiple smaller tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;**&lt;/em&gt;Edit: To spread tasks out a bit and to give myself a break between sessions, I’ve split the personal health routine up into a few seperate sessions. I place these in between the Work Blocks to keep myself active and healthy. 4 hours a day are dedicated to learning, 3 to personal health, 4 to my freelance work, 1.5 to a daily blog post, 2 to trading, 2 to miscellaneous activities and eating, and 7.5 to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;table-wrapper&quot;&gt;
  &lt;table class=&quot;alt&quot;&gt;
    &lt;thead&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;th&gt;Time&lt;/th&gt;
        &lt;th&gt;Activity&lt;/th&gt;
        &lt;th&gt;Description&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;/thead&gt;
    &lt;tbody&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;7:30AM&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;Wake-up Routine&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;Weigh-in, brush teeth, make bed, journal&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;8:00AM&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;Watch Daily Close&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;8:00 is the UTC Daily Close for my time-zone&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;8:30AM&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;Personal Health Routine&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;Meditation, yoga, and a workout&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;10:30AM&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;Lunch&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;First meal of the day&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;11:00AM&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;Work Block A&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;Trading, reading books, blog post, etc.&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;1:00PM&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;Walk&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;Break in-between work blocks, cardio + audiobook&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;2:30PM&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;Work Block B&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;Trading, reading books, blog post, etc.&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;4:30PM&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;Dinner&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;Second meal of the day&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;5:00PM&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;Work Block C&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;Part-time job&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;9:00PM&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;Work Block D&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;Trading, reading books, blog post, etc.&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;12:00AM&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;Sleep Routine&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;Brush teeth, meditate, sleep&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;/tbody&gt;
  &lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Moving Forward&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, I hope that this schedule will be able to help me stay on track of my goals and aid me in achieving the things I want to achieve. Over time, I will iteratively add or remove things that are working or not working, so everything is subject to change. Additionally, the time slots written in the schedule are not necessarily hard deadlines. It’s much better to do something later in the day than not at all just because “you missed it”. Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;
