&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the market criteria series! This series consists of my personal criteria that I look at for markets (primarily crypto) on both higher and lower time-frames. Today, we will quickly introduce and layout a simple framework that I use when making decisions to enter or exit the market. This framework consists of three main variables: approach, criteria, setups, and is the first iteration of my trading system and the first step in my trading journey. Let’s briefly talk about each one, as well as some additional information such as peripheral software, exchange platforms, progress reports, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Important: Please note that while my style of writing may seem as if this content is written for the public, in reality that is not the focus or purpose of this website. These posts are primarily designed to force accountability and attention to detail into my habitual skill set, as well as to serve as a personal documentation of my progress. None of this constitutes financial advice, nor am I a financial advisor. However, if you do find any value from my content, I am very happy to have done so.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Approach&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept of approach is all about how I aim to look at and digest all of the information given to me by the market. Think of it as an order of importance within my trading system, my personal philosophy on trading, or my feelings and/or biases towards the market. While this may be unintuitive, one of the most important things I aim to strive for as a discretionary trader is the minimization of personal discretion. However, I am also attempting to maintain sole control over the decisions that I make in the market rather than following the signals of a fully autonomous system/program (read: “bot”). Ultimately, I would like to develop a discretionary style of trading that allows for on-the-fly decision making but also enough structure and criteria requirements that it eliminates potentially harmful psychological biases and human error.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first step within this system is nothing new or special. In fact, basically every trader I know does this, regardless of profitability. I take a top-down approach to the market, and look at the higher time-frames first (monthly, weekly, daily) to market out key price areas. Then, I move onto lower time frames such as the 4H or 1H, and occasionally the 15m to further refine these key areas. Generally, I’ll stay on these lower time frames (1H/4H) and look for candle close confirmation for entries. Only after taking a look at the overall market picture do we begin to look at additional criteria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Criteria&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there are a seemingly endless number of techniques, indicators, and oscillators, I will be focusing on a few particular concepts/tools that I will go into brief detail below. These techniques and indicators are by no means comprehensive nor representative of all possible techniques, but are simply just the ones that I am familiar with using. These topics will also be covered in detail in future posts from this series. In no particular order:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;dl&gt;
  &lt;dt&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Order Flow&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
    &lt;dd&gt;
    &lt;ul class=&quot;alt&quot;&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Delta&lt;/b&gt; - we want to see delta confirm the trend. Is there heavy positive or negative delta? How is price responding to the actions of buyers/sellers?&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Imbalances&lt;/b&gt; - are there any buying or selling imbalances in the footprint chart? How are buyers/sellers responding to movements in price? &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cumulative Volume Delta&lt;/b&gt; - how is price responding to the changes in delta over time? Are there any divergences between delta and price? &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;
  &lt;dt&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Market Profile&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
    &lt;dd&gt;
      &lt;ul class=&quot;alt&quot;&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Value Area&lt;/b&gt; - what are the levels for the value area high and value area low? Great for ranging environments.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Point of Control&lt;/b&gt; - where has the most volume taken place? Great for finding exits for positions and potential support or resistance levels.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;

  &lt;dt&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Technical Analysis&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;
  &lt;ul class=&quot;alt&quot;&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Support/Resistance&lt;/b&gt; - at what prices are more other-time-frame market participants likely to enter? This is the foundation for the rest of the criteria, and we will attempt to enter as close as possible to these levels as often as possible. &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Trendlines/Channels&lt;/b&gt; - price tends to respect these trendlines, whether through a self-fulfilling prophecy or not. These act as good points of interest when price breaks one of these.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;

  &lt;dt&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. Indicators/Oscillators&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;
  &lt;ul class=&quot;alt&quot;&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Volume and On-Balance Volume&lt;/b&gt; - we look at volume to confirm potential breakouts and trends. Does price follow volume transacted? We want to make sure that there are no clear divergences in price movement and volume.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Average True Range&lt;/b&gt; - helps us in certain situations to position size correctly and to prevent from being stopped out.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Relative Strength Index&lt;/b&gt; - great for ranging markets, and particularly useful on the higher-time frames. We primarily look for divergences in the RSI.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;Moving averages and MACD (and to an extent bollinger bands) not mentioned because while they are useful, I am staying away from introducing too many variables/criteria into my system. The ones I currently have are plenty. However, moving averages and the MACD are great for trending environments, and I occasionally do use them.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;

  &lt;dt&gt;&lt;b&gt;5. Miscellaneous&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;
  &lt;ul class=&quot;alt&quot;&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Open Interest&lt;/b&gt; - we can use open interest to gauge the exposure level of the market. We want to see open interest follow price (depending on bias). High open interest opens up the possibility of huge squeezes.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Funding&lt;/b&gt; - we can use funding to see where the majority of traders are positioned. High positive or negative funding could mean a potential squeeze.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dl&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Setups&lt;/h3&gt;
Additionally, I have a list of setups that I would like to take (and are continually collecting data for optimization purposes).  These are (in no particular order):


&lt;dl&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;dt&gt;1. Support/Resistance Retests&lt;/dt&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;We want to buy the retests of support and resistance levels, either after a break on high volume, or after a clear rejection and retest failure. Can be both a high and low time-frame play.&lt;/dd&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;dt&gt;2. Range Reversion&lt;/dt&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;We want to buy and sell the value area low or value area high of a range, anticipating that it will return to at least the point of control. Often a lower time-frame setup.&lt;/dd&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;dt&gt;3. Break from Balance&lt;/dt&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
    &lt;dd&gt;Alternatively, we want to buy the retest of the value area high or value area low if we get confirmation of a break from balance, depending on additional data like inside days and other criteria.&lt;/dd&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;dt&gt;4. Trapped Traders&lt;/dt&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;Using footprint charts, we want to spot times where traders become trapped and are immediately underwater. Often, a small push to the opposite direction pressures these traders to close their positions (read: squeeze). &lt;/dd&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;dt&gt;5. Absorption&lt;/dt&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;We want to find situations where there is a lot of aggressive buying or seller, but price is not moving to match it. This often shows up in the form of a CVD divergence.&lt;/dd&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;dt&gt;6. Naked Point of Control&lt;/dt&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;Using market profile, we can identify naked points of control and preemptively place orders there in an attempt to catch price quickly hitting it before a bounce. Very low time-frame trade.&lt;/dd&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;dt&gt;7. Technical&lt;/dt&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;Completely technical based (read: drawing lines), we can take advantage of the self-fulfilling prophecy of technical analysis. I've found that trendlines work the best for this, as other patterns are not very reliable.&lt;/dd&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;dt&gt;9. Spot Play&lt;/dt&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;Not really a setup, but in certain market conditions it may be more favorable to be flat, while other market conditions favour being exposed to crypto.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Additional Info&lt;/h3&gt;
I will be covering these setups more in depth in future posts, but this was a brief overview of how I aim to do my market analysis. To track my progress, I will be using EdgeWonk 2.0 and doing monthly performance reviews as well as posting setups (see &quot;Trader Progress&quot; for more information on my position sizing, trading parameters, etc.). For exchanges and peripheral software, I primarily trade on ByBit, Phemex, and FTX, and use TradingView and EXO Charts for market analysis (see: &quot;Miscellaneous&quot; for more information on the platforms I use).

&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest problems I faced in the first few years of discovering trading was over-trading. Often I would find myself chasing trades and generally just being undisciplined and way too discretionary. I always felt like I was being pulled in all directions by the market at will, making some of the most terrible decisions I could make on a whim, and not in tune at all with neither myself nor the market. So, in order to combat this, I decided to create a little challenge for myself. This post details that challenge, the parameters I’ve set for myself, as well as the steps that I will be taking to ensure the maximum chance of success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I am a part-time trader and have a stable side-job (and low living costs), I decided to put the vast majority of my money into alternative investments and/or income sources. Instead, I left myself with a small account (~$530 USD at the time of writing), to attempt to grow to something livable in 3-5 years. The reasoning was that if I could prove an edge over a long period of time, then I have a shot at turning full-time. If not, then I can confidently say that trading isn’t for me and put it down for good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Setting Some Goals&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, let’s set some goals first. In order to not overwhelm myself, I’ve chosen one major goal per time-frame. The short term and medium term goals will eventually be done, where I will then create new goals of the same time frame (all while working towards the ultimate goal). However in reality, I actually just started with the single long-term goal and reverse engineered all the steps I think I need to take in order to achieve that goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;b&gt;Long Term Goal (3 years+)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;Develop a high expectancy and discretionary trading system based on the principles of order flow, market profile, and technical analysis. I view this not as an endgame, but a continual never-ending process of iterative refinement and tuning. Strategies or techniques that work now may not work down the line, but I think a 3 to 5 year time-frame to look for actionable results is appropriate.&lt;/dd&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;dt&gt;&lt;b&gt;Medium Term Goal (6 months - 1 year)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;Ingrain a set of habits that I believe will give me the highest probability of success (meditation, journaling, reading). I really believe that trading is more than &quot;full-time&quot;. It requires you to be on the top of your game in all aspects of your life. Luckily, I have a very &quot;all-in&quot; personality, which is great for this kind of stuff. Unfortunately, this all-in personality does get me in trouble sometimes with the market, so learning to operate situationally is a major target for me moving forward.&lt;/dd&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;dt&gt;&lt;b&gt;Short Term Goal (1 month - 6 months)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;Set up all of the necessary peripheral support needed to ensure the greatest chance of a non-quit outcome (this blog, personal schedule, miscellaneous optimizations). I want to give myself the greatest chance of success, which means optimizing all possible aspects of my life, and using my understanding of my own psychology to get the most out of my time (similar to how a coach will know how to get the most out of their athlete).&lt;/dd&gt;

&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;My Pillars for Success&lt;/h3&gt;
With these goals, I decided to create a list of all the things I may need to implement into my daily life in order to succeed. At the end, I found that all of the things I needed to do fit into one of three categories. These are the three &quot;pillars&quot; that I believe I need to focus on.


&lt;dt&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Knowledge&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dd&gt;I realized that my knowledge of trading was very shallow. Up until this point, I had basically only done some very rudimentary technical analysis and price action, with zero regard for position sizing or risk management (or any of the other more in-depth topics like order flow, market profile, etc.). So, I decided to dive head first into learning. This meant reading books, watching online videos, joining an educational group (more on this later). If I wanted to succeed, I would need to learn as much as I could.&lt;/dd&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;dt&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Mentality&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dd&gt;Fortunately (or unfortunately, depending on how you look at it), I also realized early on that a trader's mentality is incredibly, if not the most, important aspect of trading. Unfortunately, this also meant I had to accept the fact that my current mental state is ridden with psychological biases and lacked the discipline required to properly succeed. So, in order to address some of these issues, I've decided to incorporate various activities that I believe may be a value-add in my life. Namely, I've decided to implement daily meditation into my routine.&lt;/dd&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;dt&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Efficiency&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dd&gt;Due to the task at hand being incredibly difficult, it was important for me to cut out all unnecessary distractions and optimize my lifestyle to the best of my ability. More specifically, this meant re-arranging my schedule to fit my personality. For example, I have the exact same schedule 7 days of the week now, I eat the same thing every day at the exact same time, and I follow (or hope to follow) an incredibly structured and efficient timetable. I've also completely reduced all noise from trading-related social media as I found that that greatly negatively influenced my own trading decisions.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Moving Forward&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I am optimistic about my journey, nothing is set in stone. It’s good to be able to plan ahead and detail all of the possible steps you may take, but you also need to be able to adapt to changing conditions as to not get swept away by the wind. Slowly, I have begun to implement the above ideas into my life, being careful to integrate new activities or hobbies in at a gradual pace so as to not overwhelm my own gas-tank of self-control and discipline. I hope this has been informative or insightful in some way, and thank you very much for reading all the way until here. Please join me on this journey of becoming a full-time trader.
