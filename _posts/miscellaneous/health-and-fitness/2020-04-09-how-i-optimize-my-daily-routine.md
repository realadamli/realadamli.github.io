description: A full breakdown of my daily schedule and the optimizations I made to
  fit my own personality and psychology.
---

<h3>Overview</h3>
I've always believed that structure is a vital component to a person's chance of success, yet my own life has always been unstructured and messy. In order for me to take trading seriously, it was crucial that I also take the other factors of my life into account as well. This post goes into my thought process, goals, and end-result of what I think is the most optimal schedule (for me, personally). It may also provide some insight for anyone looking to learn more about how to approach their daily life in a methodical or systematic manner.

<h3>Assumptions</h3>
To create a tailored schedule that was as efficient and optimal as possible, I first needed to make a few basic assumptions about my own personality, habits, and tendencies. To start, I made two major assumptions about my psychology.

<dl>
<dt><b>Assumption 1: "Balance is for suckers."</b></dt>
<dd>Initially, the title of this assumption may be bit misleading. While we hear about the word "balance" in society a lot, I do not believe that balance is the end all be all solution to everyone's problems. For some people it may work great, but personally I believe that I have a very "all-in" personality, where I either do something 100% or not at all (basically, I am terrible at balance). Because of this, it was essential for my schedule to reflect this. This meant that if I wanted to succeed at trading, I need to assume that I would have to reorganize my entire schedule to revolve around it.</dd><br />

<dt><b>Assumption 2: "Habits are difficult to form but easy to break."</b></dt>
<dd>Thanks to my all-in personality, I am also very impulsive. This makes it very difficult to stay on track of tasks as soon as new variables are introduced to the equation. Habits are difficult to form, but even more difficult to keep, and I find myself derailing from my schedule as soon as a minor side task or distraction comes around. This means my schedule needs to contain as many tricks or techniques to keep me focused as possible, and needs to cut out as much noise and distractions as possible.</dd>
</dl>

<h3>Goals</h3>
With these assumptions made, I established a few goals that I wanted this schedule to achieve. These are different from the long-term goals that I set out in my "BTC Challenge" post, but rather just a few ideas to keep in mind when formulating the plan.

1. Eliminate all non-essential decisions to the best of my ability. This means having the exact same schedule every day of the week, eating the same thing every day to maintain caloric goals, and in general just making as little non-trading decisions to my life as possible.

2. For all essential decisions, I want to have a clear "flow" in place so that I can go from start to end as fluidly as possible. For example, this means creating a clear documentation process/template for this blog as well as Twitter (I don't want to waste time figuring out what to write, but rather I can just fill in some pre-existing boxes).   

<h3>Initiatives and Optimizations</h3>
With these goals in mind, we can start creating a list of potential value-add activities we want to add into our schedule. However, given our assumption about habits, we need to approach habit-building with a more methodical approach. To avoid burnout, we will slowly introduce new variables into the schedule as the older activities successfully turn into habits. To aid us in this, we will be using a habit-tracking app (any will do, I personally use Streaks). Listed below are the majority of the activities I plan to add.

1. 2x Daily Meditation - the benefit here is two-fold. Meditation in the morning to help practice mental acuity and provide me improved professional performance. Meditation at night to aid in falling asleep as quickly as possible. I will be using Headspace, as I've found their gamification and design to be the most user-friendly for noobs like me.

2. Yoga - trading is mainly a sitting activity, and I do not have a standing desk. It's crucial for me to be flexible and not have my body hold me back after sitting for many hours in the day. I will be using a free app called Down Dog.

3. Workout - I've been into fitness for a long time, but recently I've let myself get out of shape (both from laziness as well as coronavirus). It is visibly affecting my life negatively, so I would like to get back into it. I'd like to be a bit more functional, as the past few years I've mainly focused on bodybuilding/powerlifting, so I've recently downloaded Nike Fitness Club and will be doing workouts on there. Bonus points for being able to do it at home.

4. Healthy Eating - Similar to #3, I haven't been able to eat healthy and I feel lethargic and tired all the time. Because I used to be an athlete, I have a solid understanding of nutrition. So, moving forward I will be eating a 2400 calorie diet, 150-180g of protein, 20%-25% of calories will be fat and the rest will be carbohydrates. The goal with this was to slowly lose weight (~1 lb a week), so as to not impair my mental functionality if I were to be more aggressive (2+ lb a week).

5. Cardio - an easy 2-for-1 here, with an hour of walking + an hour of audiobooks every day. I'm not a huge fan of audiobooks because I don't retain as much information, but something is better than nothing. I'm lucky I have a giant park next to my house.

6. Books - will be spending the majority of my time reading books. To increase retention, I will be spending more time on each book, but I will be writing down notes and posting them here for future reference. These can be found under the "Education" section of this website.

<h3>Schedule</h3>
Finally, this is the schedule that I am currently working with. I've split it into blocks/routines, where each section may be comprised of multiple smaller tasks.

****Edit: To spread tasks out a bit and to give myself a break between sessions, I've split the personal health routine up into a few seperate sessions. I place these in between the Work Blocks to keep myself active and healthy. 4 hours a day are dedicated to learning, 3 to personal health, 4 to my freelance work, 1.5 to a daily blog post, 2 to trading, 2 to miscellaneous activities and eating, and 7.5 to sleep.

<h3>Moving Forward</h3>
Overall, I hope that this schedule will be able to help me stay on track of my goals and aid me in achieving the things I want to achieve. Over time, I will iteratively add or remove things that are working or not working, so everything is subject to change. Additionally, the time slots written in the schedule are not necessarily hard deadlines. It's much better to do something later in the day than not at all just because "you missed it". Thanks!
