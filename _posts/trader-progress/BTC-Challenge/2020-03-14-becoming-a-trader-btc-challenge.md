<h3>My Trading Journey</h3>
One of the biggest problems I faced in the first few years of discovering trading was over-trading. Often I would find myself chasing trades and generally just being undisciplined and way too discretionary. I always felt like I was being pulled in all directions by the market at will, making some of the most terrible decisions I could make on a whim, and not in tune at all with neither myself nor the market. So, in order to combat this, I decided to create a little challenge for myself. This post details that challenge, the parameters I've set for myself, as well as the steps that I will be taking to ensure the maximum chance of success.

Since I am a part-time trader and have a stable side-job (and low living costs), I decided to put the vast majority of my money into alternative investments and/or income sources. Instead, I left myself with a small account (~$530 USD at the time of writing), to attempt to grow to something livable in 3-5 years. The reasoning was that if I could prove an edge over a long period of time, then I have a shot at turning full-time. If not, then I can confidently say that trading isn't for me and put it down for good.

<h3>Setting Some Goals</h3>
So, let's set some goals first. In order to not overwhelm myself, I've chosen one major goal per time-frame. The short term and medium term goals will eventually be done, where I will then create new goals of the same time frame (all while working towards the ultimate goal). However in reality, I actually just started with the single long-term goal and reverse engineered all the steps I think I need to take in order to achieve that goal.

<dl>
<dt><b>Long Term Goal (3 years+)</b></dt>
  <dd>Develop a high expectancy and discretionary trading system based on the principles of order flow, market profile, and technical analysis. I view this not as an endgame, but a continual never-ending process of iterative refinement and tuning. Strategies or techniques that work now may not work down the line, but I think a 3 to 5 year time-frame to look for actionable results is appropriate.</dd><br />

<dt><b>Medium Term Goal (6 months - 1 year)</b></dt>
  <dd>Ingrain a set of habits that I believe will give me the highest probability of success (meditation, journaling, reading). I really believe that trading is more than "full-time". It requires you to be on the top of your game in all aspects of your life. Luckily, I have a very "all-in" personality, which is great for this kind of stuff. Unfortunately, this all-in personality does get me in trouble sometimes with the market, so learning to operate situationally is a major target for me moving forward.</dd><br />

<dt><b>Short Term Goal (1 month - 6 months)</b></dt>
  <dd>Set up all of the necessary peripheral support needed to ensure the greatest chance of a non-quit outcome (this blog, personal schedule, miscellaneous optimizations). I want to give myself the greatest chance of success, which means optimizing all possible aspects of my life, and using my understanding of my own psychology to get the most out of my time (similar to how a coach will know how to get the most out of their athlete).</dd>

<h3>My Pillars for Success</h3>
With these goals, I decided to create a list of all the things I may need to implement into my daily life in order to succeed. At the end, I found that all of the things I needed to do fit into one of three categories. These are the three "pillars" that I believe I need to focus on.


<dt><br /><b>1. Knowledge</b></dt><dd>I realized that my knowledge of trading was very shallow. Up until this point, I had basically only done some very rudimentary technical analysis and price action, with zero regard for position sizing or risk management (or any of the other more in-depth topics like order flow, market profile, etc.). So, I decided to dive head first into learning. This meant reading books, watching online videos, joining an educational group (more on this later). If I wanted to succeed, I would need to learn as much as I could.</dd><br />

<dt><b>2. Mentality</b></dt><dd>Fortunately (or unfortunately, depending on how you look at it), I also realized early on that a trader's mentality is incredibly, if not the most, important aspect of trading. Unfortunately, this also meant I had to accept the fact that my current mental state is ridden with psychological biases and lacked the discipline required to properly succeed. So, in order to address some of these issues, I've decided to incorporate various activities that I believe may be a value-add in my life. Namely, I've decided to implement daily meditation into my routine.</dd><br />

<dt><b>3. Efficiency</b></dt><dd>Due to the task at hand being incredibly difficult, it was important for me to cut out all unnecessary distractions and optimize my lifestyle to the best of my ability. More specifically, this meant re-arranging my schedule to fit my personality. For example, I have the exact same schedule 7 days of the week now, I eat the same thing every day at the exact same time, and I follow (or hope to follow) an incredibly structured and efficient timetable. I've also completely reduced all noise from trading-related social media as I found that that greatly negatively influenced my own trading decisions.</dd>

<h3>Moving Forward</h3>
While I am optimistic about my journey, nothing is set in stone. It's good to be able to plan ahead and detail all of the possible steps you may take, but you also need to be able to adapt to changing conditions as to not get swept away by the wind. Slowly, I have begun to implement the above ideas into my life, being careful to integrate new activities or hobbies in at a gradual pace so as to not overwhelm my own gas-tank of self-control and discipline. I hope this has been informative or insightful in some way, and thank you very much for reading all the way until here. Please join me on this journey of becoming a full-time trader. Thank you!
