description: Performance review for April 2020. A month of successful experimentation, clear improvement, but poor execution.
---

**Overview**

April has been an interesting month so far. Overall, we didn't make much progress in terms of our PnL, but we did progress quite a bit in our overall read on the market, our setup optimization, and overall confidence. However, we didn't make any progress at all on execution and psychology, succumbing to too many overleveraged, and oversized trades. This meant that we gave away most of our profits in the long-run, while risking our entire account. Not too happy with this, but it's a work in progress!

<blockquote>Note: Currently, we are hedged into spot from 9188, along with a small short. This brings our unrealized monthly PnL% up to 10%, though our realized PnL% is only at 3.27%.</blockquote>

**Review**

The majority of the first half of April was spent doing trading related peripheral activities like building this website (Jekyll + Github Pages is awesome!), and getting my routine in order (developing meditation habits, exercise, diet, etc.). My first trade I took this month was actually on April 18th.

Overall, I'm very happy with the improvements I've made in my market analysis. I feel that I have a more holistic approach to markets now, and have developed the proper habit of looking at the market from a complete perspective (ie. looking at funding, open interest, heatmaps in addition to the regular chart). Because of the recent choppy conditions, I have been testing a very low-time frame scalping strategy that relies on pockets of high volume on the footprint chart and exchange-specific price action to snipe entries for maximum risk:reward. I'm very happy to say that the testing has gone very well, and that I will continue to optimize this strategy before eventually fully adopting it into my setup list. I'm also very happy with the fact that I feel that I am able to read the footprint chart much better now, and am able to identify key areas of participation/interest.

Unfortunately, my pscyhology and discipline greatly lacked this month. Because of the strategy testing, this meant that I ended up stringing many losses together in a row as I was fine-tuning the strategy. This drawdown really ate at me, which caused me to end up over-leveraging and over-sizing on multiple positions without a stop. While it ended up working out this time, I need to be mindful that this was a fluke and should this behavior continue, I will be liquidated eventually one day. I attribute this lack of discipline to the fact that the account that I'm actively trading with is relatively small compared to my full balance, which makes me feel as if I don't have any skin in the game. Will need to think of strategies to combat this behavior moving forward.


**Moving Forward**

I want to continue to improve my analysis skills, but my main focus is to work on my discipline. I will be spending some serious time developing a plan to address these issues (as recommended by Ray Dalio in his book Principles, of which you can find the chapter summaries on this blog!), as well as dedicating even more time to understanding the biases that I encounter while trading.

Additionally, meditation is now a habit in my life, so my next step is to re-incorporate exercise (been enjoying lots of at-home-boxing due to quarantine with the occasional dumbbell workout), yoga, and proper diet as I have been slacking on that end.

Thanks for reading, I hope your trading month has gone well! I'm very excited for things to come, and I hope you can join me on this journey. :)
