<h3>Overview</h3>
This is my trader progress review for March 2020. For those who are new, you can find an introduction to what I'm doing at the following link: [Becoming A Trader: BTC Challenge]({% post_url /trader-progress/2020-03-14-becoming-a-trader-btc-challenge %}). It goes over the parameters that I've set for this challenge, as well as some other information. So, let's see how I did for March!

We started off in the middle of March (right after the giant crash) with a total balance of ~$530 USD. We ended March with a balance of ~695 USD, representing a 31% increase in portfolio. However, our trading actually only represents ~7-8% of this increase, with most of the gains coming from the rise in the price of Bitcoin. At the beginning of this challenge, we held everything in BTC (starting with 0.1 BTC). By the end of March, we had moved all of the BTC into fiat as financial market turmoil left me unsure about whether or not I wanted to be exposed to Bitcoin. For more detail on the reasoning behind this, please check out the market analysis category of this blog.

<h3>Trade Data</h3>
Now, let's go over our overall trades for the month. For a more detailed look into specific trades, I occassionally post my setups/reasoning/outcomes in the trader progress category as well. Here is a picture of my Edgewonk trading journal:

<h3>Review</h3>
Looking back on March, you can see that all of the trades took place within around a week of each other. This is due to the fact that I began working on this website near the end of March, temporarily putting my trading on hold. Unfortunately, I believe that 16 trades is way too many trades to be taking, especially for such a small return (you can see from the data that my expectancy is abysmal).

From the data, it's also clear that one of my major weaknesses is closing positions too early. From my understanding, this is a combination of a few factors. Primarily, I lack confidence in my trading ability, and need to focus on being less risk averse. One of the side effects of publicly posting trades and setups on social media is that it's a completely different psychological game because there is an added element of publicity.

Finally, I need to continually improve my psychological state and understand the biases that come with closing positions too early (the book "Trade Your Way To Financial Freedom" by Van Tharp touches on this subject extensively and has helped me greatly in forming the way I view my trading).

<h3>Moving Forward</h3>
For April, I would like to minimize the amount of trades that I take. Ideally, I would look for 1-3 good trades per week. And, if no trades present themselves, I need to be okay with not taking a trade at all. Additionally, I will be focusing on improving the quality of my trade journaling as well as trade review. Thanks!
