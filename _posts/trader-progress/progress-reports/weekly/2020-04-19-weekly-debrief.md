description: In today's post, we quickly go over the trading week. We'll talk about some of the positives, negatives, and steps needed to improve.

**Overview**

This week, I put a lot of emphasis on trading Market Profile. This meant primarily two types of trades: VAH/VAL mean reversion trades and Break From Balance trades. While the data for this week is negative, I'm extremely happy with the progress I've made in testing this theory.

**Data**

Trades Taken: 6

Winners: 2

Losers: 4

Winrate: 33.33%

PnL: -4.58%

**Review**

One of the primary reasons for the negative PnL is execution. I found that while my VAH/VAL strategy works more often than not, I have a tendency to go on tilt after a stopped trade. This led to poor entries, poor decisions, and an overall loss for the week. Unfortunately, this also caused me to enter into an over-leveraged swing short, which is pretty underwater right now. Liquidation price is nowhere near though, so the risk isn't too high. I have enough room to be able to close the trade once my thesis is invalidated, albeit at a huge relative loss of capital. I found that my analysis was quite accurate, but my poor execution was the main culprit for the poor performance. This is a recurring theme in my trading, and one that I am trying very hard to fix.


**Education**

I spent the vast majority of this week learning Order Flow and Market Profile. Combined with this, I feel like I've been able to understand why some of the trades I took this week failed. Simply put, Market Profile is a great tool to get context, but Order Flow is really what I should be using to get sniper-level entries and stop positions. It really is something amazing. Particularly, I want to look at High Volume Nodes as optimal entry areas.

**Next Steps**

Next week, I would like to focus on dialing in entries, and tightening up my stops. I'm slowly gravitating towards a more scalp-focused style of trading, as it allows me to be in and out of the market quickly without having to hold positions overnight. Additionally, I want to continue to refine the way that I look at the market, as I feel like I am improving a lot on that aspect.
