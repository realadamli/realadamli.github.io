description: Today's trading week ended net positive, but consisted of all of the things you should not do as a trader. Let's go over them.
---

**Overview**

My main focus of this week was to test out a high volume node scalp strategy. Overall, the testing went fantastic and I'm slowly dialing in the variables I need to trade this on a regular basis. Trading on the other hand, didn't go as well. While I am net positive for the week, I had an abysmal win-rate. I basically did everything you shouldn't do this week, like revenge trade, over-leverage, no system, etc.

**Data**

Trades Taken: 12

Winners: 3

Losers: 9

Winrate: 25%

PnL: 0.51%

**Review**

The main reason for the poor performance is mainly psychological and lack of patience. I struggled very hard this week with simply waiting for opportunities. Instead, I entered the market at the completely wrong times using position sizes that are way too large. A big portion of the losses were due to me learning and testing the high volume node strategy, but losses should not cause me to go on tilt.

However, my market analysis has only continued to improve. I am able to effectively identify when my setups are occurring and their optimal entry conditions. This gives me great optimism because I am lacking greatly in confidence of my own skills. This lack of confidence is one of the main reasons that I am unable to execute my analysis and often go on psychological tilt. I think time will be the key here.


**Education**

This week I continued to learn about order flow, particularly the footprint tool. I learned multiple different setups as well as concepts that I am trying to apply to my trading. I've also picked up the discounted course from MacroHedged (Options), and so far it's going very well. While I am not an options trader, I think that learning about it can only aid me in my journey.

For books, I continued reading Thinking In Bets, Markets In Profile, Mind Over Markets, and Principles. But, I also picked up Anna Couling's Complete Guide To Volume Profile. To be honest, I haven't read as much as I should have this week, so I need to improve on that next week.

**Next Steps**

This week, I would like to continue to test and develop this high volume node strategy as I work my way through the MacroHedged options course. I also want to continue reading books primarily on volume profile, market profile, order flow, and general psychology.

Next week's goals include:

1. MacroHedged Options Course
2. More exercise
3. Trust development for my own trading + psychological barriers
4. More reading
