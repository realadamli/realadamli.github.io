description: We ended today's trading week with a big win, but it may not be as good as you think.
---

**Overview**

This week, I put emphasis on the application of order flow and market profile ideas that I had learned in the weeks prior. While I was doing this, I decided to slowly ease my way into MacroHedged's Options Course, as it was on a special deal and I wanted to expand my knowledge and potential tools. Overall, we had some great analysis calls this week, and ended the week with a huge win as well. However, the win came at the cost of risk management and sleep.

**Review**

Even though we missed the big Bitcoin pump, we had quite a few good setups this week. I am slowly starting to define what kind of trader I am. I believe that I would be able to develop more edge in LTF scalp trades that rely heavily on footprint charts and order flow for maximum RR potential. This will also help with my other habits and my psychology as it limits the amount of stress that I am under when going to sleep. It also suits my personality quite well of being quite rapid-paced, and will be able to provide me more feedback in terms of volume of my decisions and outcomes of those decisions. 

Unfortunately, a small equities dump near the end of the week caused me to go a bit on tilt, and I ended up opening positions without any real plan. This caused me to lose a bit of money and try to revenge trade to make it back. Ultimately, after 2 overnight days, we made a huge win to bring us up over 24.44% for the week. While this was a win, this is not good because it was done on poor psychology and discipline. The only redeeming quality about this trade was that the problem was mainly position-sizing. I did go in with a plan, I just opened too large of a position.

I also forgo a lot of exercise, diet, and habits this week to focus on trading. This was due to being over-sized and being stressed out about having to keep an eye on the position. I lost over a full nights of sleep over this mistake, which can be dangerous because it negatively affects decision making as well as disrupts any newly formed habits.


**Education**

MacroHedged's Options Course is absolutely amazing and worth the investment. The amount of detail and depth that the course dives into is really crazy, and even if you don't trade or plan to trade options, there can definitely be some value taken away from their course. Unfortunately, I do not have an extensive finance or math background, which is what wavelength the course caters to best. However, they do provide an extensive pre-reading list that even comes with a solution manual! Honestly, it made me feel like I was back in university except this time I actually could learn on my own time. Because you get to keep the course forever, there is no rush in learning the material so you can go at your own pace.

I also continued to read a few books such as "Thinking In Bets", "Principles", "Traders, Guns, & Money", as well as "Options, Futures, and Other Derivatives". For the two first mentioned, you can find summaries of their respective chapters on this blog (some may still be missing, as I have not finished them yet).

**Next Steps**

Next, I plan to continue going through the Options Course while working on the trading mistakes I made yesterday. These include:
1. More patience in waiting for the right setup
2. More discipline in my position-sizing
3. More mental clarity training (either gym, mediation, etc) to improve my tilt-resilience
