One of the biggest problems I faced in the first few years of discovering trading was over-trading. Often I would find myself chasing trades and generally just being undisciplined and way too discretionary. I always felt like I was being pulled in all directions by the market at will, making some of the most terrible decisions I could make on a whim, and not in tune at all with neither myself nor the market. So, in order to combat this, I decided to create a little challenge for myself. This post details that challenge, the parameters I've set for myself, as well as the steps that I will be taking to ensure the maximum chance of success.

Since I am a part-time trader and have a stable side-job (and low living costs), I decided to put the vast majority of my money into alternative investments and/or income sources. Instead, I left myself with a small account (~$530 USD at the time of writing), to attempt to grow to something livable in 3-5 years. The reasoning was that if I could prove an edge over a long period of time, then I have a shot at turning full-time. If not, then I can confidently say that trading isn't for me and put it down for good.

So, let's set some goals first. In order to not overwhelm myself, I've chosen one major goal per time-frame. The short term and medium term goals will eventually be done, where I will then create new goals of the same time frame (all while working towards the ultimate goal). However in reality, I actually just started with the single long-term goal and reverse engineered all the steps I think I need to take in order to achieve that goal.

Long Term (3 years+)
  Goal #1: Develop a high expectancy and discretionary trading system based on the principles of order flow, market profile, and technical analysis.

Medium Term (6 months - 1 year)
  Goal #1: Ingrain a set of habits that I believe will give me the highest probability of success (meditation, journaling)

Short Term (1 month - 6 months)
  Goal #1: Set up all of the necessary peripheral support needed to ensure the greatest chance of a non-quit outcome (this blog, personal schedule, miscellaneous optimizations).

With these goals, I decided to create a list of all the things I may need to implement into my daily life in order to succeed. At the end, I found that all of the things I needed to do fit into one of three categories.

1. Knowledge - knowledge
2. Mentality - psychology
3. Efficiency - optimization

While I am optimistic about my journey, nothing is set in stone. It's good to be able to plan ahead and detail all of the possible steps you may take, but you also need to be able to adapt to changing conditions as to not get swept away by the wind. I hope this has been informative or insightful in some way, and thank you very much for reading all the way until here. Please join me on this journey of becoming a full-time trader. Thank you!
