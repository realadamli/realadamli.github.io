**Setup**

Bitcoin formed a clean double distribution TPO setup after it's rally from 6.8k to 7.5k. Price wicked into the double print TPO low twice, eventually consolidated at the double print before ultimately breaking down (this consolidation was the key to this trade, as it meant that buyers were no longer aggressively responding to the "discount" in prices).

**Execution**

The market entry for this needs to be aggressive, as the movements are often quick and violent (and only valid on the break of structure). The typical target for this type of trade is the upper portion of the second distribution. However, there was the presence of a high volume node in the footprint chart, which made a good exit target and a perfect place to flip directional bias into a long.

Stops would be difficult to place for this as it is such a low-time frame scalp. Going for a safe stop will dramatically reduce your RR so a extremely tight stop is probably optimal (or even manual close for those with more experience).

**Result**

I managed to catch the breakdown, but failed to set a take profit at the high volume node. I ended up closing in mediocre profit but missed the bulk of the profit of the move as well as the bias flip. This was pretty upsetting because I had previously marked the high volume node with long entries only to cancel them mere hours before this trade occurred.

**Notes**

Again, my analysis of the markets has tremendously improved, but my execution and ability to use this analysis is god-awful. This is most likely due to a lack of experience and patience. It seems I am not patient enough to allow my analysis to come to fruition, as this has happened multiple times over the past few weeks.

Overall, it was still a win, albeit 1/5th of the optimal project. This was basically the only win I had this week that had sound analysis behind it. I got pretty rekt this week getting lost into the noise, trying out new strategies, not sticking to my system, and just trading on full tilt.


**Overall Score:**

Setup: Above Average - 6/10 (great initial analysis of the double distribution setup, good improvement for spotting the high volume node a day before, but poor performance for not being able to add all these variables together when it mattered)

Execution: Below Average - 3/10 (the double distribution entry was fine, but this trade basically lay itself out for me and I still wasn't able to capitalize on it. Talk about dropping the ball!)

Trade Management: Below Average - 4/10 (failure to assimilate all of this different information into )
