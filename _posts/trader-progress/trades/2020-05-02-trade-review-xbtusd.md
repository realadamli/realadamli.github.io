**Setup**

After a sustained uptrend, Bitcoin began to retrace and form a range. Many people were calling for a blow-off top pump and dump, but price managed to find fair value around the upper 8000's. The lows were aggressively sold, which can be seen in the order flow, but shorts were not able to successfully push price lower, and price began to auction higher. An initial squeeze began the formation of a symmetrical triangle, and a clear CVD divergence began to form as well. While most of my feed was calling for shorts, I believed that price would rally upwards once more, stopping out any late shorts to the party (I did not believe that there would be a free lunch). I was also following a fractal that played out perfectly up until the point equities started to dump. This eventually invalidated the fractal.

Entry: 8726

Stop: 8660

TP: 9150

RR: 6.42

**Execution**

The market entry for this type of trade should have been passive, but I instead went for an aggressive entry. This was a mistake, as I did not get the best possible price + lost money in fees. If I was more patient, I would have placed my entry slightly lower (for example at 8720), which would have coincided with the day's POC. I got a bit lucky here because price did not wick down into my stop, but I gave up a very high R:R high probability setup for a lower probability setup due to impatience.

**Result**

My thesis was correct, and price began to rally up towards the 9150 area (the first TP). Unfortunately, it stalled at a high of 9065, and began to follow the equities dump. But, since I was looking at the fractal, I was actually anticipating a dump, so managed to close at 9030, giving me a very nice 4.6R return.

**Notes**

More patience needs to be exercised with this kind of trade, as a symmetrical triangle is not enough evidence to justify a trade. Instead, more emphasis should have been placed on potential areas of liquidity (i.e. POC in this case), as this would have given me the best RR setup. Additionally, I should not have longed directly into the point of control of the previous day, that was a dumb thing to do.

I have a bad habit of starting to draw lines and trade very "technically" whenever things get too comfortable. I need to make sure that my trades are only based on sound ideas that have real evidence like order flow (drawing lines on a chart doesn't mean anything, it's incredibly unreliable in my experience).


**Overall Score:**

Setup: Above Average - 6/10 (good directional analysis using CVD, micro-structure, and market psychology. Weighed the importance of the evidence a little incorrectly, more emphasis should be placed on concrete data rather than lines on a chart.)

Execution: Below Average - 4/10 (poor entry as a result of lack of a patience.)

Trade Management: Below Average - 7/10 (didn't really change the plan once executing, and it didn't hit my TP but I successfully cut near the top.)
