**Setup**

I decided to take a long because price moved outside of the previous day value area, and seemed to show acceptance. My target was set at the range high, where I thought we would have a SFP and drop lower. Stop was placed right below the range POC.

**Execution**

I used a market-order to enter into the market. This 100% should have been a limit order, but I was too impatient.

**Result**

Unfortunately, the trade was stopped out as I don't trade on Bitmex. I trade on ByBit, so unfortunately the price action there is a bit different. Additionally, the new BTCUSDT chart from ByBit is not on TradingView yet, so I was unable to do comprehensive data analysis to find the best price points. This is very disheartening as you can see price coming back to test the POC before ultimately moving up toward my target. This has been a recurring issue lately, so I need to address this somehow. Perhaps I will move to FTX.

**Notes**

While the market showed clear signs of acceptance, I should have closed and re-entered lower as soon as I saw buyers attempt to take initiative and fail to push price higher. This was a clear sign that while there was acceptance, there was not enough follow through from buyers. A re-entry at the range POC would have seen optimal trade location.

**Overall Score:**

Setup: Above Average - 7/10 (good initial analysis, but lack of additional supporting factors)

Execution: Mediocre - 5/10 (impatient entry)

Trade Management: Below Average - 3.5/10 (failure to adapt to changing conditions)
