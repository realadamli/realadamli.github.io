Welcome to the market analysis section of this blog. Posts categorized in this section will be my personal analysis of markets (primarily crypto) on both higher and lower time-frames. This post aims to quickly breakdown the criteria that I will be looking at when making decisions to enter or exit the market.

I take a top-down approach to the market (as I'm sure you do too, hopefully), and look at the higher time-frames first (monthly, weekly, daily) to market out key price areas. Then, I move onto lower time frames such as the 4H or 1H, and occasionally the 15m.

While there are a seemingly endless number of techniques, indicators, and oscillators, I will be focusing on a few particular concepts/tools that I will go into brief detail below (and further detail in future posts).
1. Market Profile - Value Area, Point of Control
2. Order Flow - Delta, Buy/Sell Imbalances, Cumulative Volume Delta
3. Technical Analysis - Basic Support and Resistance, Trendlines/Channels
4. Indicators/Oscillators - Volume, On-Balance Volume, Average True Range, RSI, moving averages, MACD
5. Miscellaneous - Open Interest, Funding

Additionally, I have a list of setups that I would like to take (and are continually collecting data for optimization purposes). These are:
1. Support/Resistance Retests - Volume Confirmation
2. Range Reversion - VAH/VAH Trading
3. Break From Balance - VAH/VAL Break and Retest
4. Trapped Traders - Underwater Traders
5. Absorption - CVD Divergence
6. Naked Point of Control - Very Low-Time Frame Scalp
7. Technical - Trendline/Wedge Focused
9. Spot Play - Crypto/Fiat Conversion

I will be covering these setups more in depth in future posts, but this is how I will aim to do my market analysis. I will be using EdgeWonk to keep track of my trading progress (see "Trader Progress" for more information on my position sizing, trading parameters, etc.). I primarily trade on ByBit, Phemex, and FTX, and use TradingView and EXO Charts for market analysis (see: "Miscellaneous" for more information on the platforms I use).

If you made it this far, thanks very much for reading. If you enjoyed this content, please feel free to share it with your friends or on social media. This blog is primarily a journal of sorts for personal use, but if it provides any value to you I'm very happy. Thanks!
