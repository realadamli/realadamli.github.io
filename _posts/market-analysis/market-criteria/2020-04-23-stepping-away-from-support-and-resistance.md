description: An alternative take into what support and resistance really is, and some thoughts about re-framing the way we look at the market.

**Overview**

<blockquote>Buy support, sell resistance. -basically every trader ever</blockquote>

The idea of support and resistance is one of the oldest facets of trading, and for good reason. It can be drawn in such a way that is clear to even a complete beginner, and I believe that it's perceived simplicity is what makes it such a powerful and prevalent idea. However, is it really that easy? What really is support and resistance? If we're going to be honest, aren't we just drawing lines on a chart? And how come it works sometimes and doesn't work other times? What is price really doing, "under the hood", as we might say? Today, I want to go over the driving mechanics behind support and resistance, as well as potentially challenge and analyze a few of my own beliefs and ideas (and perhaps even some of yours).

Note: This post serves as a "brain-dump" for a lot of the concepts that I have been learning about. It serves as a journal of sorts for me, a place to collect my thoughts and expand upon them. Only by writing my ideas down as if I am explaining them to someone will I be able to effectively gauge how much I know/don't know, as well as identify areas where I am lacking.

**What is Support and Resistance?**


Support and resistance, from how we see it in action, are often simple lines drawn at key areas where the market seemed to have reversed direction. However, anyone who has ever traded can tell you that it is definitely not that simple. Levels get blown through all the time, and price will even extend past or never reach it on a regular basis. This is because the support and resistances that we draw are nothing more than lines on a chart.

One of the reasons I dislike drawing lines as support and resistance is the simplicity of it. Yes, it makes your chart look clean and you can get some clout on Crypto Twitter. But, if you can see it, so can everyone else. And that makes you an easy target. Now, don't get me wrong, I'm not saying that you should never use lines for levels. The important thing to note here is to not be blinded by them that you fail to recognize external factors.

For example, setting levels using lines may cause you to:

1. Get stopped out before price reverses in your predicted direction.
2. Miss a move because price didn't reach your entry.

To minimize this occurrence, we need to understand how price moves.

**Why Do Prices Move?**


Prices move because there is an imbalance in the activity of buyers or sellers. Many people may say that prices go up if there are more buyers than sellers, but given the way that markets work (a seller for every buyer, and vice versa) that is not technically correct. Instead, prices move when there is an imbalance in the aggressiveness of market participants. If buyers are impatient, they will aggressively bid up price until they believe that it is above value, and vice versa. This idea of a "two-way" auction, where buyers and sellers will react accordingly to below or above value prices is the key concept of auction market theory.

On the flip side, if prices move due to an imbalance in the aggressiveness of buyers and sellers, what makes price stop? The answer is liquidity. When there is an imbalance in market participant aggression, the market will move until it hits available liquidity. This liquidity will either get eaten up by the aggressive side (and price will continue), or it will prove too strong and price will fail to push through. This is why simply looking at a candlestick chart does not give us enough information about what is actually happening in the battle between buyers and sellers.

So, if prices have nothing to do with support and resistance lines that we draw, how can we effectively look for entries and targets? This is where we can use things like market profile, volume profile, and order flow!

**The Role of Volume Profile/Market Profile**


For me, volume and market profile lets me see the market from a bird's eye view. While the two measure different things (one is volume and the other is time), I use them similarly: to show me where buyers/sellers interacted the most. It allows me to spot potential areas of interest through high volume areas and low volume areas. For those of you not familiar with volume or market profile, I highly recommend checking out some online resources (the gentlemen over at Blockroots have an amazing course, and I've heard great things about BTCMarketProfile as well as some of the courses from Axia Futures. Alternatively, you can read a few books that I've listed at the bottom of this post).

Basically, I look at two things.

1. Point of Control - I mark these with a green box to indicate to me key areas where market participation was the highest. These often act as support and resistance to price. If you think about the mechanics behind this, this means that at these prices, there was a lot of volume transacted (meaning that at one point, it was a fair value area between buyers/sellers). Hence, it goes to reason that it will be an important area of interest in the future.

2. Low Volume Areas - I mark these with a blue box to indicate key areas where market participation was low. These are areas where price was below or above value, and buyers or sellers aggressively reacted and immediately took price away from this area (hence the low volume). You may notice that while these act as support and resistance, they will sometimes also be filled out and turned into high volume areas as price comes back and the reactions of the market participants change.

While this gives us a good idea of the overall market context, it isn't accurate enough. Trying to find entries with boxes often gives you a terrible risk:reward unless you're trading on the higher-time frames. This is where order flow comes in.

**The Role of Order Flow**


If volume/market profile is a bird's eye view, then order flow is the sniper. It allows you to look into exactly what buyers/sellers transacted at every price point in every candle. Again, I highly recommend checking out something like Blockroots, or some online resources. Currently, EXOCharts is in my opinion the best order flow platform for crypto, with Sierra Charts also being incredibly good.

For order flow, I follow a similar process except on a much lower time frame. I've found that it is incredibly good at giving you high R:R, low time frame scalps.

1. High Volume Nodes - I look for price to wick into these areas of high volume. Great for finding pockets of liquidity that almost attracts price like a magnet.

2. Delta - Delta is the difference in executed orders between the buy and sell side, aggregated for each candle. It shows you the intentions behind the market participants, as lots of aggressive buying will show heavy positive delta (and vice versa for heavy selling). In an uptrend for example, we want to see sustained positive delta. If we begin to see a shift in delta participation from positive to negative, it could tell us buyers are beginning to lose steam and exhaust themselves (aka no more buyers).

3. Absorption - absorption is important to confirm direction. For any moves, we want to ideally see buyers/sellers absorbing in the direction of the move. For example, on a trend upwards, we want to see buyers absorb (or "reload") at higher and higher prices, indicating that there are still buyers in the market. If we see heavy selling into clear signs of absorption, it is a sign that buyers are willing to buy at these higher prices, and continuation is probable. Alternatively, if we see a decrease

I didn't cover a few ideas such as cumulative volume delta, buy/sell imbalances and divergences, so maybe I will save those for a later post. Basically, we want to ask ourselves "where is price trying to go", and "is it doing a good job of getting there?".
